According to a new study with a sample of around 300 working men, one predictor of  sexual harassment is working in a place that tolerates it; another is engaging in #feminist #activism. Surprisingly, #sexualorientation is *not* a predictor of harassment by itself, but #sexualminority men *are* more likely to engage in feminist activism. All told, these findings suggest that sexual harassment may be a punishment for men who deviate from the norms of traditional #masculinity.

And it's on the increase, at least in the US. In 2013, men filed 17.6 per cent of the thousands of sexual harassment charges recorded in the country that year (up from 16.1 per cent in 2011).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0039151\"\u003enew study\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003ePsychology of Men and Masculinity\u003c/i\u003e surveyed 326 men in the US (most were white, 25 were gay or bisexual) about their experiences of sexual harassment at work. They had careers in a wide range of fields from IT to law, and their average age was 32. The study doesn't provide us with specific rates of harassment as such because the men were asked to score their experiences of different forms of harassment on a 5-point scale from 1=never to 5=very often. The average score for \"gender harassment\" (this is more often perpetrated by men against men in the form of being exposed to sexual jokes and stories, but also includes hearing or receiving derogatory remarks about men) was 1.27, and for \"sexual advance harassment\" (which includes inappropriate and unwanted touching or other sexual advances) was 1.14.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA key finding was that men who said they engaged in more forms of feminist activism \u0026ndash; for example, they attended meetings or signed a petition \u0026ndash; also tended to report experiencing more sexual harassment, of both types. Kathryn Holland and her colleagues said this is consistent with the idea men who challenge the existing gendered hierarchy at work end up getting punished (just as women do) \u0026ndash; a phenomenon they refer to as \"gender policing\". If it sounds strange to think of women punishing men who challenge men's unfair dominance at work, remember that \u003ca href=\"http://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/11/queen-bees-are-consequence-not-cause-of.html\"\u003epast research\u003c/a\u003e has shown that some women cope with a macho work culture by adapting their own identities, in some cases becoming \"Queen Bees\". For these women, and others who find a way to thrive in a masculinised environment, any challenge to the status quo can be seen as a threat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther findings to emerge from the survey: men's sexuality was not related to how much harassment they reported; men's harassment scores were (not surprisingly) higher in organisations that had a cultural tolerance of harassment; and men who reported experiencing more harassment also reported lower well-being and job satisfaction. Intriguingly, however, on the last point, men who engaged in more feminist activism seemed to be protected against the ill effect of being harassed \u0026ndash; perhaps, the researchers surmised, this is because they are less likely to blame themselves and are more aware of problematic gender-based beliefs in society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe researchers said their study \"helped advance our understanding of sexual harassment of men in the workplace\". But a major caveat to the findings is that it's possible men who spend more time standing up for women's rights report being harassed more themselves, not because they really are, but simply because they are more sensitive to and attuned to instances of sexual harassment, whether directed at colleagues or themselves. This would undermine the claim that they are being punished for their feminist activism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_________________________________  \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.researchblogging.org/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"ResearchBlogging.org\" src=\"http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal\u0026amp;rft.jtitle=Psychology+of+Men+%26+Masculinity\u0026amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org\u0026amp;rft.atitle=Sexual+harassment+against+men%3A+Examining+the+roles+of+feminist+activism%2C+sexuality%2C+and+organizational+context.\u0026amp;rft.issn=1939-151X\u0026amp;rft.date=2016\u0026amp;rft.volume=17\u0026amp;rft.issue=1\u0026amp;rft.spage=17\u0026amp;rft.epage=29\u0026amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.apa.org%2Fgetdoi.cfm%3Fdoi%3D10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rft.au=Holland%2C+K.\u0026amp;rft.au=Rabelo%2C+V.\u0026amp;rft.au=Gustafson%2C+A.\u0026amp;rft.au=Seabrook%2C+R.\u0026amp;rft.au=Cortina%2C+L.\u0026amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal\u0026amp;rft.jtitle=Psychology+of+Men+%26+Masculinity\u0026amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org\u0026amp;rft.atitle=Sexual+harassment+against+men%3A+Examining+the+roles+of+feminist+activism%2C+sexuality%2C+and+organizational+context.\u0026amp;rft.issn=1939-151X\u0026amp;rft.date=2016\u0026amp;rft.volume=17\u0026amp;rft.issue=1\u0026amp;rft.spage=17\u0026amp;rft.epage=29\u0026amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.apa.org%2Fgetdoi.cfm%3Fdoi%3D10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rft.au=Holland%2C+K.\u0026amp;rft.au=Rabelo%2C+V.\u0026amp;rft.au=Gustafson%2C+A.\u0026amp;rft.au=Seabrook%2C+R.\u0026amp;rft.au=Cortina%2C+L.\u0026amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology\"\u003e\u003cspan title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal\u0026amp;rft.jtitle=Psychology+of+Men+%26+Masculinity\u0026amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org\u0026amp;rft.atitle=Sexual+harassment+against+men%3A+Examining+the+roles+of+feminist+activism%2C+sexuality%2C+and+organizational+context.\u0026amp;rft.issn=1939-151X\u0026amp;rft.date=2016\u0026amp;rft.volume=17\u0026amp;rft.issue=1\u0026amp;rft.spage=17\u0026amp;rft.epage=29\u0026amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.apa.org%2Fgetdoi.cfm%3Fdoi%3D10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rft.au=Holland%2C+K.\u0026amp;rft.au=Rabelo%2C+V.\u0026amp;rft.au=Gustafson%2C+A.\u0026amp;rft.au=Seabrook%2C+R.\u0026amp;rft.au=Cortina%2C+L.\u0026amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal\u0026amp;rft.jtitle=Psychology+of+Men+%26+Masculinity\u0026amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org\u0026amp;rft.atitle=Sexual+harassment+against+men%3A+Examining+the+roles+of+feminist+activism%2C+sexuality%2C+and+organizational+context.\u0026amp;rft.issn=1939-151X\u0026amp;rft.date=2016\u0026amp;rft.volume=17\u0026amp;rft.issue=1\u0026amp;rft.spage=17\u0026amp;rft.epage=29\u0026amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.apa.org%2Fgetdoi.cfm%3Fdoi%3D10.1037%2Fa0039151\u0026amp;rft.au=Holland%2C+K.\u0026amp;rft.au=Rabelo%2C+V.\u0026amp;rft.au=Gustafson%2C+A.\u0026amp;rft.au=Seabrook%2C+R.\u0026amp;rft.au=Cortina%2C+L.\u0026amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology\"\u003eHolland, K., Rabelo, V., Gustafson, A., Seabrook, R., \u0026amp; Cortina, L.

Carli\u0026rsquo;s paper shows that despite significant progress made, women are still thought to lack the qualities needed to be successful scientists, and the findings suggest this may contribute to discrimination and prejudice against women in those fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis new research adds critical background data to the on-going conversation jumpstarted by women scientists disclosing years of abuse and discrimination. For example, one professor recently published a New York Times op-ed about her own experience, suggesting the reality of discrimination and even abuse could explain why there are fewer women in \u003ca href=\"http://steamregister.com/tag/stem-fields/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSTEM fields\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarli\u0026rsquo;s research specifically compared how men, women, and scientists are perceived by both genders. Little research has been done on the topic of how scientists as a group are perceived, and even though much work has looked at gender stereotypes and stereotypes for leaders, for example, there previously had been no study that considered the overlap of \u003ca href=\"http://steamregister.com/tag/stereotypes/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egender stereotypes\u003c/a\u003e with stereotypes about scientists, Carli said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Common cultural stereotypes about women, men, and scientists lead people to see women as incompatible with science,\u0026rdquo; said Carli in a recent \u003ca href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-finds-that-despite-more-women-in-science-we-still-perceive-women-to-be-incompatible-with-stem-fields-300242203.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epress release\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026ldquo;Men are especially prone to this bias, but everyone shares it. This may result in prejudice (a dislike of female scientists compared with men) and discrimination against them.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe study also used students at Wellesley, an all-women\u0026rsquo;s college where Carli teaches, to gauge the effect this environment might have on stereotypes. Approaching the research in this way led Carli to uncover a surprising and telling contrast between women in this setting and women and men at coeducational institutions. Only the women from her study who attended a single-sex college saw a meaningful similarity between women and scientists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Women at coed institutions saw very little similarity and men saw none at all,\u0026rdquo; Carli said. \u0026ldquo;It may be that women attending women\u0026rsquo;s colleges have greater exposure to female scientists, and this may shift their stereotypes about successful scientists to be more like women.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Research on leadership suggests that media exposure to female leaders, such as Madeleine Albright, Angela Merkel, and Janet Yellen, increases peoples\u0026rsquo; perception that women can be good leaders,\u0026rdquo; she added. \u0026ldquo;But people have little exposure to prominent female scientists. Going to a women\u0026rsquo;s college may correct that problem.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupport for this view comes from Wellesley itself. Wellesley College alumnae are awarded more science and engineering doctorates than female graduates of any other liberal arts college in the nation. (Alumnae in STEM fields include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher, Nergis Mavalvala, who was part of the team that recently discovered proof of \u003ca href=\"http://steamregister.com/groundbreaking-discovery-of-gravitational-waves-proves-einstein-was-right/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egravitational waves\u003c/a\u003e.) Among Wellesley\u0026rsquo;s top ten majors are neuroscience, biological sciences, computer science, and math.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA closer look at Carli\u0026rsquo;s research shows that scientists are perceived as more \u0026ldquo;agentic\u0026rdquo; (e.g. risk-taking and competitive), and that these characteristics have the greatest overlap with how men are also perceived. Women are thought to be more \u0026ldquo;communal,\u0026rdquo; associated with qualities like helpfulness and kindness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;[T]he overall image of successful scientists appears to be one of exaggerated masculinity, but with fewer of the more negative qualities associated with masculinity,\u0026rdquo; Carli writes in her paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer research was comprised of two different studies. In the first, participants were given a set of descriptive terms and asked to use them to describe the characteristics of a randomly assigned group (\u0026lsquo;adult man\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;adult woman\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;successful scientist\u0026rsquo;) and to place each term on a five-point scale, with one [1] representing \u0026ldquo;not characteristic.\u0026rdquo; The aim was to examine the overlap of stereotypes about women and men and to see if the gender of the participant had an effect on how they viewed these groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second study looked at particular fields in science (e.g. biology) and examined if the number of women actually working in that discipline had an effect on how women were perceived. Like the first study, these participants were asked to describe the characteristics of a randomly assigned group; instead of \u0026lsquo;successful scientist\u0026rsquo;, the category was, for example, \u0026lsquo;successful biologist\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile generally women also perceive men and scientists to share more similarities than they feel their own gender shares with scientists, Carli\u0026rsquo;s study did find that women were \u0026ldquo;more inclined to attribute to their own gender a somewhat greater degree of agency, and to perceive a somewhat greater similarity of women to successful scientist [than men did].\u0026rdquo; She also found that the greater number of women working in a particular field, the greater a perceived similarity between women and scientists existed. However, the number of men in a particular field does not change perceived similarities. She wrote, \u0026ldquo;[G]iven that people discriminate against women even in gender-neutral fields\u0026hellip;, it may be that women have to predominate in a field before people perceive them as having the same role congruity [similarity between their gender and their field\u0026rsquo;s perceived characteristics] as men.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarli argues the implications of her study are clear. As she wrote in the paper, \u0026ldquo;These data suggest that the challenges women face as potential scientists may go beyond the perception that science is a poor match with women\u0026rsquo;s communal goals or that more scientists are men [and] not women.\u0026rdquo; Her findings are also a call to action. We must be \u0026ldquo;more aware of these potential biases and attempt to compensate for them in evaluating women and girls in STEM,\u0026rdquo; she argues in the article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarli is a senior lecturer in psychology at Wellesley and is an authority on gender discrimination and the challenges faced by professional women.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"96571286"},"body":"This is the translation of the answers of MRAs to feminists about domestic violence and patriarchy:\n\n1a) It's useless to say that \"as if anyone had ever tried to deny the male rights\" because it was precisely the feminists in the '70s that denied the shared custody.\nIt is precisely the feminists that killed Erin Pizzey's dog and sent threats to her, because she wanted to talk about male victims of domestic violence; It is precisely the feminists who sent bomb threats at the wedding of the daughter of Suzanne Steinmetz, a researcher who has been guilty of showing how domestic violence is equal between men and women.\nFeminists are the ones who say that \"there is patriarchy and men are privileged\" ... dear, if you say that men are privileged and then that they have issues too, maybe it's time to choose between the two things, right? Otherwise, the diagnosis of multiple personality disorder is ensured.\n\n1b) The MRA movement has never said that women are privileged, women as well as men have their problems, BUT WE, unlike the feminists, do not say that women's issues are \"a consequence of gynocentrism\", we don't turn women's issues to make them look like men's issues. But we could, we could say that women who have been oppressed are only a negative consequence of the gynocentric idea that women should be protected, and men not. See how easy it's to twist the truth?\n\n2a) \"to compare the violence that women carry out on men to the reverse is nonsense. Even statistically. And the studies conducted by interviewing a sample that is around at a rate of up to 0.003% of the population are not available at a purely scientific point of view \"\nWell, then I wonder why in national studies such as the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS), the National Family Violence Surveys (NFVS) and the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), when it was investigated the percentage of victims of domestic violence in the previous 12 months (which is more reliable than the lifetime, because unlike the latter the 12 months picture does not show bias in recall - \"One-year prevalence\" are considered to be accurate blackberries [than lifetime rates] because they do not depend on recall of events long past \"(Straus, 2005, p. 60)\" http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17596591211244166), from 40% in NVAWS (which, remember, is a feminist study) to 53% of NISVS (which is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a governmental association) of victims of domestic violence are men. Similar rates between the sexes (ie around 50 and 50 between males and females) is also finded when there are combined different types of serious violence (eg. Severe physical abuse, severe psychological violence, controlling behavior, legal violence / administrative and injuries) . (Source:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733469/)\n\n2b) The reason why ISTAT does not mention it? Quite simply: because ISTAT does not ask the men when and if they have been victims of domestic violence.\n\n2c) The data about the murders? They depend on detentions. But:\n- The imprisonment of men last longer for the same crime, so you have more chance to count them in a given period. In fact, for the same offense men have 63% longer sentences;\n- even here for the same crime and with the same criminal background, men have DOUBLE the chance of being incarcerated. (Source of the two previous data, directly from the University of Michigan Law School to you: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002)\n- Finally Felson and Pare, in 2007, analyzing data from the National Violence Against Women Survey, showed that women who assail their partners have much more chance of not being detained because of prejudice: (source: https://richardfelson.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/does-cj-treat-leniently.pdf)\n\nSo, if we count disparities in sentencing, disparities in incarceration and disparities in arrests, here we explain the difference between studies showing equal rates for men and women and police reports.\n\n3a) \"every single \"double standard\" shown in this cartoon is attributable solely to the patriarchy and machism that MRA encourage\"\nReporting domestic and sexual violence on men means encouraging the machism? Are you kidding me? The MRA fight machism and just read some old article to understand it. Indeed, perhaps it's certain feminists who pretend to fight machism and then encourage it secretly to confirm the concept of \"violence is masculine.\"\n\n3b) When a woman purpose a sexist law, feminists say she has been \"internalized misogyny\", thus confirming that it is not those who are at the top, but those below, all of us, our culture, to form, to shape the state of art. This is intuitive, because is the bottom,  the population that elects, people who candid theyself come from families of the rest of the population, so who is elected is a mirror of the people who elected him. But it was the same even before democracy, even in tyrannies it's searched the support of the people to avoid being knocked over.\nSo it is the culture to be sexist, then to talk about \"patriarchy\" as the basis of sexism does not make sense. But it makes no sense even because to create a patriarchy it's objectively necessary to have a system of gender roles in order to say \"yes let's put men at the head\" (but also \"yes, let's put men to die in wars\"...). This system, the system of sexism, then, is the culture, not the government. So there it's the origin of sexism. So to say \"buh patriarchy\" makes no sense.\n\n3c) To say that the men's problems are the result of patriarchy or sexism is like saying that women's issues are the result of gynocentrism or misandry.\nI know how the feminists think, they tell you \"well it's also offensive to women\" when something goes in favor of the female sex. Dear ones, EVERYTHING can be offensive if you see it from this point of view. Even a woman who is discriminated on her job from this point of view is something offensive to men because \"men are seen as the only ones that must work,\" even a woman who is raped and her rape have been justified can be seen as offensive to men from this point of view because the justifications consider men as beasts who can't control themselves. So ALL is offensive to everyone. So or things are both mysandric that misogynistic (but at this point please make it note how \"it's offensive for men\" even when happen events at detriment of women), or if you do not want to see the slightest offense against men resulting in situations against women, you must avoid at the same way to see the slightest offense against women in situations resulting in damage to men.\n\n4a) \"the underlying message is \"YOU WOMEN are privileged, so shut up.\" False. False as the hair of Donald Trump\"\nOh no, what is written in your post is false. False as Antonio Conte's hair.\n\n4b) The message is \"we too have problems, then continue acting to solve the yours without belittling our own.\" But I see that you can't at all.","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"816377"},{"$numberLong":"4984179"},{"$numberLong":"1000533"}]}
{"_id":{"$numberLong":"96571288"},"body":"La risposta di Diritti Maschili - MRA Italia agli attacchi ricevuti. Da leggere!\n\nRiportiamo in parte:\n\"E' inutile dire \"come se qualcuno avesse mai cercato di negare i diritti maschili\" perché furono proprio le femministe negli anni '70 a negare l'affido condiviso. \nSono proprio le femministe che hanno ucciso il cane di Erin Pizzey che voleva parlare delle vittime maschili di violenza domestica e mandatole minacce; sono proprio le femministe che hanno mandato minacce di bomba al matrimonio della figlia di Suzanne Steinmetz, ricercatrice che ha avuto la colpa di mostrare come la violenza domestica sia paritaria tra uomini e donne.\nSono proprio le femministe a dire che \"esiste il patriarcato e gli uomini sono privilegiati\"... cara, se dici che gli uomini sono privilegiati e poi che hanno questioni anche loro, forse è il caso di mettersi d'accordo, no? Altrimenti la diagnosi per disturbo di personalità multipla è assicurata.\n\n1b) Il movimento MRA non ha mai detto che le donne sono privilegiate, le donne come gli uomini hanno i loro problemi, solo che noi, a differenza delle femministe, non diciamo che i problemi delle donne sono \"conseguenza del ginocentrismo\", ovvero noi non rigiriamo le questioni femminili per farle sembrare questioni maschili. Potremmo, potremmo dire che le donne che sono state oppresse sono solo una conseguenza negativa dell'idea ginocentrica che le donne vadano protette e gli uomini no. Vedete com'è facile rigirare la frittata?  \n\n2a) \"paragonare la violenza che le donne compiono sugli uomini a quella inversa è un'assurdità. Anche a livello statistico. E studi compiuti intervistando un campione che si attesta attorno a una percentuale pari al massimo allo 0,003% della popolazione non sono validi da un punto di vista prettamente scientifico\" \nBenissimo, allora chissà come mai in studi nazionali come il National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS), il National Family Violence Surveys (NFVS) e il National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), quando è stata indagata la percentuale delle vittime di violenza domestica nei 12 mesi precedenti (che sono più attendibili rispetto al lifetime, perchè a differenza di quest'ultimo non mostrano bias nel recall - \"One-year prevalence \"are considered to be more accurate [than lifetime rates] because they do not depend on recall of events long past\" (Straus, 2005, p. 60)\" http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17596591211244166), si rileva dal 40% del NVAWS (che, ricordiamo, è uno studio femminista) al 53% del NISVS (che è dei Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, associazione governativa) di vittime maschili nell'ambito della violenza domestica. Percentuali simili tra i sessi (ovvero attorno al 50 e 50 tra maschi e femmine) si hanno anche quando vengono combinati diversi tipi di violenza grave (es. violenza fisica grave, violenza psicologica grave, comportamenti di controllo, violenza legale/amministrativa e lesioni). (Fonte:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733469/)\n\n2b) Il motivo per cui l'ISTAT non ne parla? Molto semplicemente perchè l'ISTAT non chiede agli uomini quando e se sono stati vittime di violenza domestica.\n\n2c) I dati sugli omicidi? Dipendono dalle incarcerazioni. Ma: \n- le incarcerazioni degli uomini durano di più a parità di reato, quindi si ha più possibilità di contare uomini in un dato periodo. Infatti a parità di reato gli uomini hanno sentenze il 63% circa più lunghe;\n- sempre a parità di reato e di precedenti, gli uomini hanno il DOPPIO di possibilità di essere incarcerati. (fonte dei due dati precedenti, direttamente dall'University of Michigan Law School a voi: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002 )\n- infine Felson e Pare, nel 2007, analizzando i dati del National Violence Against Women Survey, hanno mostrato che le donne che assaliscono i loro partner hanno molta più possibilità di non essere arrestate a causa dei pregiudizi: (fonte: https://richardfelson.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/does-cj-treat-leniently.pdf)\n\nErgo se contiamo disparità nelle sentenze, disparità nelle incarcerazioni e disparità negli arresti, ecco che ci spieghiamo la differenza tra studi che mostrano parità e report della polizia.\n\n3a) \"ogni singolo \"doppio standard\" illustrato in questa vignetta è imputabile solo ed esclusivamente al patriarcato e a quel machismo che gli MRA incoraggiano\" \nDenuciare la violenza domestica e sessuale sugli uomini significa incoraggiare il machismo? Stiamo scherzando? Gli MRA combattono il machismo e basta leggere qualche vecchio articolo per capirlo. Anzi, forse sono certe femministe che fanno finta di combattere il machismo per poi incoraggiarlo segretamente per confermare il concetto de \"la violenza è maschile\". \n\n3b) Quando una donna propone una legge sessista le femministe dicono che è stata \"misoginia interiorizzata\", dunque confermano che non è chi sta in alto, ma chi sta in basso, tutti noi, la nostra cultura, a formare, a forgiare lo stato delle cose. Questo è intuitivo, perchè è dal basso che poi si elegge, la gente che si candida proviene da famiglie \"del basso\", quindi chi viene eletto è uno specchio della gente che lo elegge. Ma è così anche da prima delle elezioni, anche nelle tirannidi si cercava l'appoggio del popolo per non venire rovesciati. \nErgo se è la cultura a essere sessista, allora parlare di \"patriarcato\" come base del sessismo non ha senso. Ma non ha senso a priori perchè per creare un patriarcato oggettivamente è necessario avere un sistema dei ruoli di genere che ti dica \"sì mettiamo gli uomini a capo\" (ma anche a morire in querra...). Questo sistema dunque è culturale. Ergo è lì l'origine del sessismo. E dunque dire \"buh patriarcato\" non ha senso.\n\n3c) Dire che le problematiche maschili siano frutto del patriarcato o del maschilismo è come dire che le tematiche femminili sono frutto del ginocentrismo o della misandria. \nSo come ragionano le femministe, ti dicono \"beh è offensivo anche verso le donne\" quando una cosa va a vantaggio del sesso femminile. Care, TUTTO può essere offensivo se lo si vede da questo punto di vista. Anche una donna che viene discriminata sul lavoro a questo punto è qualcosa di offensivo per gli uomini perchè \"gli uomini vengono visti come gli unici a dover per forza lavorare\", anche una donna che viene violentata e giustificato il suo stupro è offensivo verso gli uomini perchè si considerano gli uomini come degli animali che non riescono a controllarsi. Ergo TUTTO è offensivo verso tutti. Quindi o le cose sono sia misandriche che misogine (ma a questo punto fate notare come \"sia offensivo verso gli uomini\" anche quando accadono eventi a danno delle donne), oppure se non si vuole vedere la minima offesa verso gli uomini derivante in situazioni a danno delle donne, bisogna evitare allo stesso modo di vedere la minima offesa verso le donne derivante in situazioni a danno degli uomini.\n\n4a) \"il messaggio di fondo è \"SIETE privilegiate, quindi ZITTE\". Falso. Falso come i capelli di Donald Trump\"\nOh no, quello che è scritto nel post è falso. Falso quanto i capelli di Antonio Conte.\n\n4b) Il messaggio è \"anche noi abbiamo problemi, quindi agite per i vostri senza sminuire i nostri\". Ma proprio non ci riuscite.\"","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"816377"},{"$numberLong":"4984179"},{"$numberLong":"1000533"}]}

The research finds that the children of people with bad draft numbers (more likely to have gone to Vietnam) make about $200 \u0026ndash; $500 less fifty years later than the children of similar people who were less likely to have gone to Vietnam. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like much, but since only about 10% of the people in the bad-draft-number category actually ended up in Nam and this is the effect that must be driving the average difference, it might be that those children are making $2000 \u0026ndash; $5000 less, which actually \u003ci\u003eis\u003c/i\u003e a lot (note that this was during a period when very few Americans died in Vietnam, so not much selection effect; the paper also adjusted for all the other reasonable objections I can think of).

Among other things, studies have reported that sexual orientation is linked to \u003ca href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ebs/5/4/214/\"\u003efacial symmetry\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20364887\"\u003efinger length ratios\u003c/a\u003e (specifically, the length of the second digit compared to the fourth digit), as well as \u003ca href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10900997\"\u003ewhich hand is dominant\u003c/a\u003e. A new study published in the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2015.1124831\"\u003eJournal of Sex Research\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e suggests that height is one additional physical feature we should add to this growing list, at least for men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this study, researchers analyzed the data of 863 Canadian adults (415 men; 447 women) who were recruited for a study of sexuality and physical development. Approximately half of the participants came from college campuses, whereas the other half were recruited at off-campus locations (e.g., at LGBT pride events) in an attempt to obtain more sexual diversity. Participants were 26 years old on average, and most were White and had completed at least some college. Just about half of the sample was gay or bisexual, while the other half was heterosexual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to collecting information on participants\u0026rsquo; sexuality, researchers obtained two measures of height: a self-report measure and an objective measure, in which height was determined by a research assistant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe results revealed that both men and women overstated their height on the self-report measure compared to the objective one, which provides evidence for the importance of collecting objective data in studies of this nature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow did height relate to sexual orientation? When looking at the self-report measure, there was no association with sexuality. However, when looking at the objective measure, there was\u0026mdash;but only for men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, heterosexual men were significantly taller than gay men. To put this in perspective, the difference in average height was a little over 2 centimeters (about 0.8 inches).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBisexual men did not differ in height compared to either gay or heterosexual men. In addition, there were no differences in objective height between lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI should note that in the analyses mentioned above, researchers statistically controlled for age, ethnicity, education level, recruitment location, and whether participants were compensated for taking part in the study in an attempt to rule these out as possible alternative explanations for any differences observed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what might account for the height difference between gay and straight men? The researchers argue that it\u0026rsquo;s consistent with other research and theory suggesting that prenatal hormone exposure affects adult sexual orientation. The basic idea is that when male fetuses are exposed to different hormone levels (e.g., lower testosterone), this has effects on the brain that create a predisposition to homosexuality; at the same time, this also generates a number of physical changes (e.g., effects on height).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for why the difference in height was only observed for men, we cannot say for sure; however, scientists believe that sexual orientation may develop differently in men and women (i.e., there may be different mechanisms at play), so that could explain why the height effect was specific to men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are some important limitations of this research. For one thing, the sample was not representative, and the gay and heterosexual participants were largely recruited from different venues (most gay participants were from LGBT pride events, while most heterosexual participants were from college campuses). In addition, we cannot infer cause-and-effect from these data or pinpoint the source(s) of the observed differences in height among men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also important to highlight that, while this study found a height difference on average, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e the case that all heterosexual men are taller than all gay men. There is a lot of individual variability, so you cannot just look at a man\u0026rsquo;s height and infer his sexuality based on that alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI should also mention that although there are some very tall gay men out there, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily invalidate the prenatal hormone theory because many researchers believe that there isn\u0026rsquo;t a single cause for a given sexual orientation. There may be multiple paths. This means, for example, that two people could be gay, but they could have very different physical features and the underlying factors contributing to their sexuality could be very different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore research is needed, especially studies looking at the link between objective height and sexuality in more representative samples; however, these results are consistent with several other studies in pointing to a likely biological basis for the development of sexual orientation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to learn more about \u003cem\u003eSex and Psychology \u003c/em\u003e?

According to the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html?pagewanted=all\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u0026ldquo;traditional dating in college has mostly gone the way of the landline, replaced by \u0026lsquo;hooking up.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; With women outnumbering men on most college campuses, we are told, women can\u0026rsquo;t attain the long-term relationships they \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e want, because there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough men to go around. Men, \u0026ldquo;as the minority, hold more power in the sexual marketplace\u003cstrong\u003e,\u0026rdquo; \u003c/strong\u003eand they use it to promote a culture of casual sex on campus. Instead of going out on dates, young adults are supposedly meeting up at their homes to \u0026ldquo;Netflix and chill\u0026rdquo; or hooking up at big parties, then moving on to the next in a long series of casual sex partners. This is said to harm their chance of entering long-term romantic partnerships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHow accurate is this picture? We recently analyzed a survey of over 24,000 college students, collected at 22 colleges and universities around the United States between 2005 and 2011, and found that reports of the death of dating are greatly exaggerated. College students have essentially equal rates of hooking up and dating. Since beginning college, approximately 62 percent reported having hooked up, while 61 percent said they had gone out on a date. Only 8 percent of all students had hooked up without ever going on a date or being in a long-term relationship. More than 3 times as many students \u0026ndash; 26.5 percent \u0026mdash; had never hooked up at all, but instead had dated and/or formed a long-term relationship. So while it is clear that hookups are widespread, they have certainly not replaced the traditional date.\u003cspan\u003eCollege students have essentially equal rates of hooking up and dating.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen\u0026rsquo;s rate of hooking up was 3.5 percentage points higher than women\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ndash; a difference that is statistically significant but very small. However this was not necessarily because men preferred more casual relationships. In fact, 71 percent of the men, compared to just 67 percent of the women, said they wished they had more opportunities to find a long-term romantic relationship. And almost two-thirds of the men expressed the desire for more chances to date, compared to less then half who reported wishing they had more chances to hookup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe idea that men are leveraging their scarce presence on campus to avoid long-term relationships and force women to settle for unsatisfactory hookups is also called into question by a number of other findings in the survey. Women were not substantially more likely than men to regret their last hookup; only 14.5 percent of women, versus 12.5 percent of men, regretted their last hookup. Overall a similar number of men (48 percent) and women (45 percent) instead reported being glad about their most recent hookup encounter (the rest were neither glad nor regretful). Other \u003ca href=\"http://contexts.org/blog/hookups-sex-and-relationships-at-college/\"\u003erecent research\u003c/a\u003e finds that even though men are more likely than women to have an orgasm during hookup sex, men and women are almost equally likely to report enjoying their most recent hookup. Our research also revealed that on campuses with a higher proportion of women, women were not more likely to hookup with men or less likely to form long-term relationships with them. They were instead more likely to have dated other women.\u003cspan\u003eThe idea that men are leveraging their scarce presence on campus to avoid long-term relationships and force women to settle for sexually unsatisfactory hookups is also called into question.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile hookups certainly do not carry the expectation of a lasting commitment, many do in fact lead to one. \u003ca href=\"http://nationalmarriageproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NMP-BeforeIDoReport-Final.pdf\"\u003eA recent report\u003c/a\u003e found that one-third of recent marriages that they studied began in a hook-up context. And despite the prevalence of hookups during their college years, female college graduates are in the long run \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2014/ted_20140328.htm\"\u003emore like to marry\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e than women with less education. Since women now earn more degrees than men, this means that many marriages are between a woman and a less educated husband, but contrary to widespread concerns, \u003ca href=\"https://contemporaryfamilies.org/gender-revolution-rebound-brief-marriage-becoming-more-egalitarian/\"\u003erecent research\u003c/a\u003e finds this is no longer a risk factor for divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur survey did find some problematic behaviors associated with many college hookups. A full half of all men and 46.5 percent of women reported engaging in \u003cem\u003ebinge\u003c/em\u003e drinking (defined as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more for men) during or right before the hookup. Students who were binge drinking (male as well as female) faced a higher risk of sexual assault. And even when sex was consensual, each additional drink during or right before a hookup was associated with lower sexual enjoyment from the hookup for both men and women. Other \u003ca href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23127230\"\u003erecent research\u003c/a\u003e confirms that women in particular are more likely to feel discontented with their hookups when they drink beforehand. In fact, 31 percent of women and 28 percent of men report they would not have hooked up with the partner at all had they not been drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMost students who described themselves as having \u0026lsquo;hooked up\u0026rsquo; either didn\u0026rsquo;t have sex during their last hookup or used a condom when they did. Overall, 42 percent of hookups included vaginal or anal sex. Of these, only 13.3 percent included \u003cem\u003eunprotected\u003c/em\u003e vaginal or anal sex. In other words a majority of hookups did not end with sex, and more than two-thirds of students who did have sex during hookups used a condom. Students who had sex on dates also used condoms two-thirds of the time, but since only 22 percent of dates included sex, that meant that only 7 percent of all dates included unprotected sex. So the chance of having unprotected sex was almost twice as high in a hookup as on a date.\u003cspan\u003eA majority of hookups did not end with sex, and more than two-thirds of students who did have sex during hookups used a condom.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents who were intoxicated were more likely to have unprotected sex during a hookup. Binge drinking increased the likelihood that students would have unprotected sex during their hookup by around one-third, and using marijuana during a hookup (which 11 percent of students reported) was associated with nearly double the risk of unprotected sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSurprisingly, truly casual hookups tended to be safer than others. Women who reported knowing their partner \u0026lsquo;very well\u0026rsquo; were almost 60 percent more likely to have unprotected sex during a hookup, despite not having an exclusive relationship with that partner, than women who only knew their partner \u0026lsquo;somewhat.\u0026rsquo; When students had repeated hookups with the same non-exclusive partner, they were more likely to have unprotected sex in later hookups; each additional hookup with the same partner increased the risk of unprotected sex by 17 percent. These students may feel a false sense of security with that partner, leading them to take unnecessary risks. Also, women may worry that asking their partner to use a condom would be seen as mistrustful and, as a result, avoid the issue when hooking up with a friend or otherwise well-known partner.\u003cspan\u003eSurprisingly, truly casual hookups tended to be safer than others.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHookups were most common among fraternity and sorority members, who were more than twice as likely as non-members to have hooked up but were no more likely to form a long term relationship while in college, despite the fact that sorority members were about 50 percent more likely than non-members to want more opportunities to form long-term relationships in college, and \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003emore likely to want hookup opportunities. Fraternity and sorority members were also both about 50 percent more likely to binge drink while hooking up compared to non-members. On the other hand, sorority members were less likely than other college women to report unprotected sex during their last hookup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReligious service attendance was also related to whether or not students hooked up, but in distinct patterns for men and women. Women who attended religious services at least once a month were significantly less likely than women who attended services less frequently or never attended services to have ever hooked up in college, and when they did hookup they were less likely to have unprotected sex, or any sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor men, a different pattern emerged. Men who attended services a few times per year but less than once per month were the \u003cem\u003emost \u003c/em\u003elikely to have either hooked up or dated in college \u0026ndash; more likely than men who never attended services. And college men who attended services most frequently \u0026ndash; at least once a month \u0026ndash; had hookup rates similar to those who never attended. Religious service attendance also had no impact on the likelihood of a man engaging in unprotected sex during hookups. Religious standards of sexual morality seem to constrain the behavior of very religious women; men, on the other hand, may be using religious social networks to find casual sex partners, counteracting any suppressing effect religious doctrine may have on casual sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThree groups stood out as having significantly lower rates of unprotected sex during hookups compared to other students: men hooking up with men, women who were members of sororities, and students who met hookup partners in dormitories. What do these groups have in common? Each has been the target of accurate, non-judgmental public health and sexual education campaigns.\n\u003cp\u003eSpreading accurate information about risks related to binge drinking during hookups and emphasizing clear, honest communication with partners about condom use, even with trusted partners, could mitigate the many risk factors found in our research. In the absence of these risk factors, hooking up does not appear to have the bad results that are often attributed to it. Rather than panicking about the death of romance on campus, accepting hooking up as part of the normal campus scene while educating about the specific behaviors that make it risky or unpleasant can more effectively protect college youth.\u003cspan\u003eThree groups had\u0026nbsp;significantly lower rates of unprotected sex during hookups: men hooking up with men, women who were members of sororities, and students who met hookup partners in dormitories.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"104252062"},"body":"A new study highlighting gender inequality in sex has found that young women are more likely than men to perform oral sex on their partner even if they don't want to. Researchers set out to investigate attitudes towards oral sex in young heterosexual males and females aged between 16 to 18-years-old, and interviewed 71 individuals. Many of the teenagers said there was equality in giving and receiving oral sex. However, further questioning showed that men used highly negative language to describe women’s genitals. And both men and women agreed it was more distasteful and a \"bigger deal\" for men to perform oral sex than women. Women were more ambivalent than men to receive oral sex because they were aware that female genitals are negatively perceived. The study also revealed that young men were more likely to say they did not perform oral sex if they did not want to. In contrast, the young women questioned were less likely to say no to a partner, and instead tried to make giving oral sex palatable. In addition, participants said it was “easier” for men to receive oral sex than women. The study was carried out by teams at the University of the Pacific and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and was published in the ‘Journal of Sex Research’. Ruth Lewis, co-author of the study and sociologist at University of the Pacific, said there has been a lot of research into vaginal intercourse, but less is known about attitudes towards oral sex among young adults. The research showed there is an \"urgent\" need for sex education to cover topics above \"just pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections\", she said. \"It's clear that we also need to be encouraging young people to think critically about how women's and men's bodies are talked about in society, the nuances of consent and coercion, and how gender equity might be negotiated in practice.\" The study comes after previous research showed that young girls feel they are coerced into having anal sex. Researchers who interviewed teenagers aged between 16 to 18-years-old found that young people are performing more anal sex, but that some young people normalised “coercive, painful and unsafe anal sex”.

Great, actually, because that's not the reality for most young couples, according to research by University of the Pacific and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In the study, published in the Journal of Sex Research, researchers interviewed 71 men and women ages 16 to 18, then conducted follow-up interviews one year later. Both the men and women said that performing oral sex on women is a \"bigger deal\" than performing oral sex on men. By \"bigger deal\" they meant it's more \"distasteful\" for men than women, and that it is \"easier\" for men to receive. The whole give-and-take stance of you scratch my back, I scratch yours isn't really happening. \"There has been a lot of research on vaginal intercourse but we know much less about young people's expectations and experiences of other sexual practices,\" sociologist and study author Ruth Lewis said in a press release. \"This was an exploratory study to start to give us an idea of how young people talk about oral sex.\" The language men use to talk about women's genitals isn't pretty (though the press release doesn't include the word choice for obvious reasons). This \"highly negative\" attitude obviously rubs women the wrong way. And, because they're acutely aware of men's perceptions, they're less than thrilled to receive oral sex. What's more, young men were much more likely than women to say they didn't perform oral sex if they didn't want to, while young women tended to give in, describing strategies they use to make giving oral sex more palatable.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"104252433"},"body":"Apparently, gender equality has not reached the bedroom—at least for teens who are having oral sex. A new study in the Journal of Sex Research found that boys and girls ages 16 to 18 view fellatio and cunnilingus very differently. Most of the 71 interviewees considered oral sex to be a bigger deal when the recipient was female, and they felt it was easier for men to receive oral sex and harder for them to give it. While boys just didn't perform oral sex if they didn't feel like it, girls pushed through and found ways to make it more pleasant. And girls and boys alike expressed negative views of female genitalia. Sigh. Depressing as this is, it shouldn't come as a surprise, given that more college men than women are receiving oral sex during their hookups. And yet, there's hope! According to Indiana University's National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, this pattern reverses with age. Women were indeed more likely than men to give oral sex over the course of the past year at younger ages, with the discrepancy peaking at 74 percent vs. 55 percent at ages 20 to 24, but the ratio flipped by ages 30 to 39, when 69 percent of men and 59 percent of women reported giving oral sex over the past year. So if you're in your early 20s, things might look bleak right now, but at least you've got something to look forward to.","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5103506"}]}
{"_id":{"$numberLong":"104252594"},"body":"When a pair of researchers set out recently to survey teenagers’ attitudes about oral sex, they found something encouraging: Both boys and girls expressed an ethic of sexual reciprocity. They said things like, “it’s give and take,” “you give to receive” and “you do me, I’ll do you.” Ladies and gentlemen, the fruits of sexual liberation! Or not. The researchers also discovered a contradictory attitude, one often expressed at the very same time. Many teens felt it was a “bigger deal” for a man to perform cunnilingus than for a woman to give a blow job—and that, well, vaginas are kind of gross. For all their initial posturing about oral parity, boys and girls alike saw oral sex for men as a default, and cunnilingus as an optional and less desirable undertaking. The study, published in the Journal of Sex Research, surveyed 71 young men and women in England between the ages of 16 and 18 about their experiences with and attitudes toward oral sex. The researchers, from the University of the Pacific and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found that many of the teens talked about oral sex as a mutual exchange. As one 17-year-old girl said, “Licking out and blow jobs, it’s like, they like go together, it’s like what happens with one person happens to another.” But, despite these attitudes, teens often indicated that cunnilingus was a far bigger ask. One 17-year-old boy told the researchers, “I think giving head is probably a lot less worse for girls than a boy licking out a girl, because … with a boy, it is just skin, basically, and with a girl, it is more like … it’s skin, but it’s sort of wet and fleshy, and it’s different,” he said. “And that’s where they pee out of as well. Like it is … obviously boys pee out of their dick as well, but, like, only at the end. Like all the pee touches all of that area, sort of.” Ah, the eloquence of teen sex talk. Many young men described the vulva and vagina as “dirty,” “disgusting,” “nasty,” “droopy,” “messy,” “saggy” and “stinking.” It’s no wonder young women not only agreed that it was easier to perform oral sex on a man than on a woman, but also that it was easier for men to receive and enjoy it. As a 16-year-old girl put it, “The way girls talk about it, is more of a big deal than it would be to a boy,” she said. “I think you’d be more likely to give a blow job because licking out, again, like … girls have a lot of insecurities … like I said about [pubic] hair and things like that because … in school boys made such a big deal about things like that.” She added, “I think all males really like it being done to them but, um, like, it’s … a lot of girls say, like, the same, it’s just … they don’t really like it. They feel uncomfortable.” Big surprise: The boys confirmed this. As the researchers put it in the paper, “Men, by contrast, generally expressed unqualified enthusiasm for receiving oral sex.” And in the rare instances in which they didn’t enjoy it? They blamed it on their female partner’s poor technique. Young women’s discomfort with receiving oral sex also served as a handy excuse for young men not always returning the favor. As one 17-year-old man told the researchers, he values reciprocity but “some girls aren’t comfortable … just don’t like it.” The researchers pointed out that this “allowed him to portray himself as fully compliant with a reciprocal imperative without actually having to reciprocate each time.” Only two young men in the survey described themselves as enthusiastic about performing cunnilingus. In general, oral sex for women was seen as “optional,” while blow jobs were “constructed as routine, taken for granted, or even obligatory,” according to the study. The researchers argue that these paradoxical attitudes—about oral parity and the default nature of blow jobs—makes sense in a larger cultural context. “Young people’s simultaneous use of apparently contradictory constructions of oral sex reflects a collision of broader prevailing discourses of heterosex emphasizing ‘female empowerment,’ on one hand, while prioritizing men’s pleasure, on the other.” The solution, says researcher Ruth Lewis, is, well, what it always is. “Sex education should cover much more than just pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections,” she said in a press release. “It’s clear that we also need to be encouraging young people to think critically about how women’s and men’s bodies are talked about in society, the nuances of consent and coercion, and how gender equity might be negotiated in practice.”","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5103506"}]}
{"_id":{"$numberLong":"104252681"},"body":"Photo Credit: Shutterstock If you are a lesbian with a sexually satisfied partner, thank you for the visit, but you are free to go elsewhere. There’s probably not much you can gain from this article that you don’t already know. As one woman explains, “When two women bump junk, the chance of oral sex being involved is high.” A study published by the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that lesbian women are significantly more likely to experience orgasm than their heterosexual counterparts. That can be teased out in a few different ways. Lesbian women are members of a lucky minority that get to ditch gender expectations of pleasure and performance often associated with traditional intercourse. They’re also incredibly well-versed in the female body and its orgasmic intricacies. My guess is that most of them are unsurprised by the fact that nearly 70 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation to orgasm, and it seems likely that many look to the tongue as a useful means of delivering it. Back in 2014, vlogger Arielle Scarcella decided to ask 500 of her straight-identifying female viewers and 500 lesbian viewers whether they preferred oral sex to penetration. Fifty-five percent of straight women preferred penetration. Just 25 percent of lesbian viewers agreed. In her analysis, Scarcella says, “Straight women are very uncomfortable with the idea of receiving sexual pleasure without giving it at the same time.” According to the Kinsey Institute, heterosexual women are more likely to be nearly always or always orgasmic when alone than with a partner. When in a partnered environment, women seem much more likely to orgasm when they engage in a variety of sex acts, like oral sex. Men, on the other hand, don’t typically have a problem achieving orgasm through penetrative sex alone. When we apply that information to the fact that the average American woman has about one orgasm for every three a man experiences, it seems like something’s not adding up. Or rather, that certain someones aren’t going down. Like most terrible trends, we might trace this one back to our formative years. In a study of 71 young adults aged 16-18, researchers found that women were more likely than men to perform oral sex on their partners, even if they didn’t want to. Both male and female subjects said it was a “bigger deal” for men to perform oral sex than it was for women. They said it was “easier” for men to receive oral sex than women. They also noted that cunnilingus was more “distasteful” than fellatio. Given the fact that most sex education focuses on pregnancy and periods in place of pleasure, that doesn’t seem totally surprising. In Peggy Orenstein’s book Girls \u0026 Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape, she cites a study of high schoolers that claims the number one reason girls partake in oral sex is to improve their relationships. The research team found that “girls thought of fellatio kind of like homework: a chore to get done, a skill to master, one on which they expected to be evaluated, possibly publicly... Although they took satisfaction in a task well done, the pleasure they described was never physical and never located in their own bodies.” She notes that the girls seemed socialized to see themselves as “learners not yearners” in the context of sexual encounters. But why? Orenstein discusses the rise of the word vagina as a sort of punchline. “Snarky references to women’s nethers are the new fag,” she writes. “A way to denigrate masculinity, to ridicule or dominate an opponent… The implication is that everyone shares a secret distaste toward a lady’s parts, or at least a sense that the word vagina itself is a goof.” She’s right to assert that society hasn’t always held a soft spot for vaginas. While little boys are free to roam around pointing to their “pee-pees,” no such word exists for the prepubescent vagina. As Orenstein once told AlterNet, “There’s nothing between the navel and the knees.” In her book she writes, “Leaving something unnamed makes it quite literally unspeakable.” Maybe one day, we’ll follow in the footsteps of the Swedes, who introduced the word “snippa” to the official dictionary of the Swedish language back in 2006. But for now, baby girls born stateside will have to do without. Growing up, the conversation doesn’t seem to get any easier. Tween heartthrob Robert Pattinson didn’t think twice about throwing the snatch under the bus when he told Details magazine, “I really hate vaginas. I’m allergic to vagina.” And the web is a welcome home to more vaginal hostilities. Just take a look at a Vice article in which the author describes the vulva as “a wound in an otherwise perfect whole.” It’s hard for those on the cusp of sexual maturity not to take that to heart. Hell, it’s hard for those of us well into our sexual maturity not to get a little down about that. It never feels good to be identified as the source of someone else’s disgust. Even worse is when that attitude is internalized and self-applied. Of course, no one should be coerced into performing a sexual act they aren’t comfortable with. Those who find the vulva so nightmarish (a word borrowed from the Vice article), are free to stay away from them. But we need to remind girls that reciprocity is a big part of sex. If guys aren’t willing to deliver the orgasms they deserve through one of the most reliable means possible, maybe it’s time to examine the blind impulse to do the same for them. Talk of oral equality won’t find its way to the tip of every tongue, but those who feel compelled to sweep it under the rug might think about the significance of the female sexual experience, and how overlooking it can play into the dangerous tendency to treat womankind as a symptom of man.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"105659832"},"body":"A new study of British teenagers delves into the social norms that stigmatize cunnilingus and lead to gender inequality in oral sex. The study, called Oral Sex, Young People, and Gendered Narratives of Reciprocity, was recently published in the Journal of Sex Research. It was conducted by Ruth Lewis, a sociologist at the University of the Pacific, and Cicely Marston from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Lewis and Marston spoke to heterosexual teenagers whose ages ranged from 16-18 years old and who hailed from numerous regions in Britain. In total, there were 37 young women and 34 young men in the study, and all were interviewed to gain insight into the younger generation's cultural understanding of cunnilingus versus fellatio. Lewis and Marston's conversations with the teenagers revealed that vulvas and vaginas were deemed gross and unappealing by the majority of surveyed teenagers, no matter their gender, and that going down on a woman is thought of as a \"bigger deal\" than going down on a man. This is not the first study to refer to disparities in oral sex based on gender. A 2015 study by the University of Toronto, explained Medical Daily, found that while women are twice as likely to perform oral sex on a man, they are less likely to enjoy receiving oral sex. It's one thing to simply not enjoy oral sex; it's another to not enjoy it because you are ashamed of your body. This new study expresses some of the cultural attitudes that shape this unfortunate reality for many women. I spoke to Dr. Jennifer Caudle, Family Physician and Assistant Professor at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, about the study findings. Dr. Caudle says that while the study may not be expansive, it still highlights an important issue. \"This was a smaller study and a limited pool of research subjects, so I do ask, is this the case regardless of age group or country? But even if it's a small pool,\" Dr. Caudle tells Bustle, \"it shows that a lack of body confidence is happening among young women. And I see it in my own patients.\" Let's take a closer look at these frustrating research findings: 1. Cunnilingus Is Apparently \"Distasteful\" And Too Complicated Both the young men and young women in the study used negative terms such as \"distasteful\" when describing cunnilingus. These negative reactions materialized when the subjects were asked to compare going down on women to going down on men. The statistical majority of participants also said that oral sex on women is \"a bigger deal\" than oral sex on men; male sexual desire is normalized while female sexual desire is misunderstood as confusing and less important. This, of course, comes as no surprise — whether we are discussing faked orgasms, silence around female performance anxiety, the gendered concept of virginity, or slut shaming. Both the young men and young women in the study also expressed that fellatio is much easier than cunnilingus — which is justification for refusing to perform cunnilingus? Yes, cunnilingus can be tricky, but all you have to do is ask for guidance. But if socialization conditions men and women to view cunnilingus as a gross act that requires too much effort, then no one is going to want to talk about how to do it. 2. We Are Socialized To Consider Men's Pleasure To Be More Important Please refer to the first item in this list. And then please adopt Nicki Minaj's philosophy, for the greater good of womankind. According to the interviewee responses, it was also much more common for men to refuse to perform cunnilingus if they were \"not in the mood.\" How shocking that it was women who felt pressured and obligated to go down on their partners as soon as their partners asked for it, even if they weren't in the mood. Once again, providing men with pleasure is normalized while providing women with pleasure is not. As explained by Medical Daily, \"Some of the girls even described strategies they used to make the experience more tolerable, such as having a drink next to them to mask an unpleasant taste.\" While social norms that celebrate men's orgasms as the only orgasms certainly hold partial responsibility for the interviewee responses, the researchers still found more disturbing cultural attitudes... 3. We Are Socialized To Consider Women's Sexual Organs To Be Gross Whether it was young men or young women talking about cunnilingus versus fellatio, the act itself was not the only thing disparaged. Vaginas and vulvas themselves were frequently spoken of as dirty abnormalities. Young men's remarks featured the words \"nasty\" and \"stinking\" when describing women's genitals. No wonder many of the interviewed women expressed disinterest in cunnilingus because they were uncomfortable with the idea of a man's face near her vulva. Here in the States, it is not uncommon for grown women to have never looked at their own vulvas because of internalized stigmatization regarding the female body. Dr. Caudle says she sees this same discomfort and lack of body ownership among her female patients — especially the younger ones. \"Sometimes, as a physician, I do get a sense that women don't have the same confidence about their sexual organs that I experience with male patients,\" she says. \"While it's difficult for all genders to talk about sexual health with their doctor, from my younger women patients, there is a lot of shyness, reluctance, and less body confidence when they talk about these things. It's so sad; I want my female patients to be as body confident as men.\" 4. Men Who Enjoy Cunnilingus Are \"Strange\" If vaginas and vulvas are considered strange, then it follows that men who openly celebrate them are considered strange, too. When researchers asked teenage girls their thoughts on men who enjoy cunnilingus, many responded by calling those men \"weird\" or \"different.\" There was an identical stigma in teenage boys' circles, especially teenage boys from London. A 16-year old boy is quoted in the research as saying, \"They call you a bocat [a negative term used to describe men that give oral sex to women]. It’s an insult basically, but if you were to get [oral sex] from a girl just the complete opposite [i.e., you would be congratulated].\" 5. Sex Ed Can Make Things Better As we've seen again and again, comprehensive sexuality education can make so many things better. Marston explained that the study results demonstrate the need for a whole new method of teaching youth about sexuality, pleasure, sexual health, and consent. Marston said, “It is vital to ensure that young people receive comprehensive sexuality education that addresses the importance of mutuality — discussing and agreeing to sexual activities that both participants want to do.” Want more of Bustle's Sex and Relationships coverage?

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"105659903"},"body":"Performing oral sex on women is considered a 'bigger deal' than on men, and the act is also considered 'more distasteful' for men to perform on women than vice versa, according to the results of a new study. The study, published online in the Journal of Sex Research, was conducted in England by University of the Pacific sociologist Dr Ruth Lewis and Dr Cicely Marston of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It involved interviews with a group of 16-18-year olds, who were interviewed again a year later. The study focused on accounts of oral sex between men and women, rather than same-sex couples. The interviews revealed that the language young men used to talk about vulvas and vaginas was often highly negative, and that many young women were 'highly ambivalent' about receiving oral sex because of their awareness of these perceptions. Participants also said that receiving oral sex was 'easier' for men than for women. When asked about their own sexual practices, young men were much more likely than young women to say that they simply did not perform oral sex if they didn't want to, while young women were more likely to describe strategies to make giving oral sex more palatable. Read IBTimes UK's Facebook Q\u0026A with Laura Bates on the oral sex study here The idea that women's bodies are inherently dirty, disgusting or unclean is a deeply ingrained and old fashioned form of misogyny, so it is troubling to see that such perceptions may still exist even among today's young people. We are still battling against the idea that men's sexual pleasure is assumed, while women's is an occasional treat or afterthought; and the idea that women are expected to perform oral sex, but men are to be praised as generous and progressive when they do. All these notions belong in the distant past, yet they seem to be stubbornly persistent. Lewis suggested that the findings pointed to the need for a greater focus on gender equality in sex in relationships education: \"Sex education should cover much more than just pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. It's clear that we also need to be encouraging young people to think critically about how women's and men's bodies are talked about in society, the nuances of consent and coercion, and how gender equity might be negotiated in practice.\" We are still battling against the idea that men's sexual pleasure is assumed, while women's is an occasional treat or afterthought; and the idea that women are expected to perform oral sex, but men are to be praised as generous and progressive when they do. The trends revealed by the study chime with reports to the Everyday Sexism Project, in which women often describe pressure to perform oral sex on male partners, an act that is not always reciprocated. The notion of vaginas and vulvas being 'disgusting' or off-putting also arises frequently. One entry reads: \"A (now ex) boyfriend told me that 'the girl always gives more oral sex in a relationship than the boy, ask any of your friends' and that 'vaginas were gross, you don't really want me down there gagging do you? Pleeaasse can you give me head though because you're so good!' I'd like to point out I do not suffer from any kind of yeast infection or pH imbalance that would make me less than averagely pleasant 'down there'; even freshly showered he wouldn't go near it\". Susan Quilliam, advocate for sex and relationship health and education, and author of The New Joy of Sex, has a unique insight into the subject as she coaches, writes and trains about intimate relationships. She suggests that modern pornography is partly responsible for perpetuating old stereotypes. Posts on Everyday Sexism: \"The girl always gives more oral sex in a relationship than the boy, ask any of your friends\" \"You don't really want me down there gagging do you?\" \"He told her that he wished she'd enjoy performing oral sex on him, like the girls in porn\" She says: \"I strongly suspect that a lot of it comes from the fact that there are fewer role models of a man giving a woman oral sex. We see lots of role models of a man penetrating a woman, in pornography and even written pornography. There are lots of role models of women loving giving men oral sex and loving the 'cum shot' – but far fewer role models, in both hard and soft porn, of a man delivering oral sex to a woman.\" Another Everyday Sexism entry also suggests a connection between porn and sexual norms. \"One of my female friends came to me really upset once. She said that she and her boyfriend were really having issues in the bedroom area. She felt like her boyfriend was always comparing her to porn. When she told him that she felt like he expected her to give him oral sex often and it felt more like an obligation, rather than something that was intimate and in the moment, he told her that he wished she'd enjoy it, like the girls in porn. She said she always felt under pressure to perform and largely, it wasn't for her enjoyment, or even mutual enjoyment but because he had certain expectations of what a women should be like in the bedroom. He didn't perform oral sex on her.\" In Hollywood films, too, we are much more used to seeing women performing oral sex on men, while it is still considered a risqué rarity to see women receiving oral sex. It has often been suggested by film makers that movies depicting the latter receive higher age ratings than those portraying the former. Talking to young women suggests that stereotypical notions about oral sex don't necessarily always come directly from male partners themselves. Jane*, a 29-year old from London, says: \"Society has made me feel like my vagina is a dirty thing and it's less nice for men to give oral sex. I don't think this idea has come from any specific man I have been involved with so much as a general feeling – I'm not sure where it comes from.\" Quilliam agrees – she is quick to note that when she worked as an agony aunt for a men's magazine a lot of the letters she received were from readers who wanted tips on giving oral sex and how best to please their girlfriends: \"What I'm seeing is a wave of young men who are taking their responsibilities more seriously.\" She doesn't believe, however, that equality has yet been achieved, and fears that generational problems may be repeating themselves. So how do we solve the problem? Moving towards more equality of representation would be a positive step, Quilliam suggests. She thinks we need to be \"talking about it and writing about it – I'm a great believer in normalisation. Allowing the free speech of artists, allowing women's empowerment.\" She refers to examples of works that have busted stigma around vulvas and vaginas, like Jamie McCartney's Great Wall of Vagina. But progress is disappointingly slow, Quilliam says. \"When I was growing up I firmly believed that in the generations to come women would be much more empowered – I wrote a book in 1992 called Women on Sex where I thought in 20 years women would be completely empowered. Unfortunately it was rubbish.\" Laura Bates is the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project *Name changed for anonymity.","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5103506"}]}

According to The Independent, a study was carried out on 71 individuals aged between 16 to 18 years of age. The research suggests that females are more likely to perform oral sex on their partner, even if they don't want to. The results found that although many of the teenagers felt there was equality between men and women when it came to giving and receiving oral sex, it was still considered to be a 'bigger deal' for men. The questioning also proved that some of the men referred to women's genitals with very negative language. Vice's \"Broadly\" channel recently demonstrated that this issue is not limited to 16-18-year-olds when it asked a number of men why they don't perform oral sex on women, with the answers ranging from \"I just don't like it\" to \"the smell is intolerable\". And the study conducted among 16-18-year-olds found that the female particpants said negative perception around female genitalia was a factor in women not being more forthcoming when asking their partners for oral sex. To those men out there who don't want to go down on a woman because they don't like the look of her lady bits, we feel inclined to remind you that us fellas aren't exactly endowned with the most attractive genitalia in the world.

Lovers' handsGender inequalities persist in the experiences and expectations of oral sex among young men and women, but are often glossed over by young people, according to a study in the Journal of Sex Research. The study was conducted by researchers as part of the sixteen18 project on young people’s sexual practices at the London School of Hygiene \u0026 Tropical Medicine. For this part of the study, they interviewed 71 men and women aged 16 to 18 in England, and conducted follow-up interviews a year later. The study focused on accounts of oral sex between men and women, rather than same-sex partners. The researchers found that despite often talking about an ethic of equal give-and-take in oral sex, most interviewees described performing oral sex on women as a “bigger deal\" than oral sex on men. In particular, both men and women said giving oral sex was more distasteful for men than women, and receiving was \"easier\" for men than women. The authors say while there has been a lot of research on vaginal intercourse, much less is known about young people's expectations and experiences of other sexual practices. The interviews revealed that the language men used to talk about women's genitals was often highly negative, and that women can be ambivalent about ‘receiving’ oral sex in part because of their awareness of these perceptions. In addition, young men were much more likely than women to say they simply did not perform oral sex if they didn't want to, while young women tended to describe strategies to make giving oral sex more palatable. Study author Dr Cicely Marston, Senior Lecturer in Social Science at the London School of Hygiene \u0026 Tropical Medicine, said: “Gender inequalities are clearly not confined to vaginal intercourse: even a practice that is talked about as equal turns out to be more problematic for women than for men. This underlines how important it is to pay attention to gender dynamics as part of sexuality education and sexual health promotion” Dr Ruth Lewis, study author now at the University of the Pacific, said: \"Sex education should cover much more than just pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. It's clear that we also need to be encouraging young people to think critically about how women's and men's bodies are talked about in society, the nuances of consent and coercion, and how gender equity might be negotiated in practice.\" The study was funded by a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council in the UK.

Pero al parecer esto no sería del todo cierto al hablar de sexo oral, pues las chicas jóvenes serían más propensas a darlo aun cuando no desean hacerlo, según un estudio publicado en la revista científica The Journal of Sex Research. ¿A ellos les gusta menos? La investigación se llevó a cabo en Inglaterra por las sociólogas Ruth Lewis, de la Universidad del Pacífico; y Cicely Marston, de la Escuela de Higiene y Medicina Tropical de Londres. Para llegar a estos resultados, ellas entrevistaron a 71 hombres y mujeres de entre 16 y 18 años de edad, y les hicieron otra encuesta de seguimiento un año después. Las preguntas se centraron en las veces que habían tenido sexo oral con miembros del sexo opuesto, según un comunicado de prensa de la Universidad del Pacífico. Resultó que, tanto hombres como mujeres, dijeron que dar placer oral parecía ser más desagradable para los chicos que para ellas. Esta investigación parece concordar con otro estudio que sugiere que los hombres reciben más sexo oral que las mujeres. Mala percepción Además, se descubrió que el lenguaje que usan los hombres al hablar sobre los genitales femeninos era altamente negativo. Y por eso, al ser conscientes de las percepciones de los varones, las mujeres se mostraban menos dispuestas a recibir placer oral. El estudio también reveló que los muchachos eran mucho más propensos a negarse a dar sexo oral cuando no estaban de humor. Pero en el caso de las mujeres, las cosas fueron muy diferentes, ya que ellas sí lo daban, aun cuando no querían hacerlo. Algunas jóvenes incluso describieron que sus parejas utilizaban estrategias para hacer la experiencia más tolerable para ellas, como darles una bebida para enmascarar un sabor desagradable. Como ves, la popular regla del “primero tú y luego yo” no sería muy aplicada al hablar de esta actividad sexual.

Expertos aseguran que generalmente la mujer cuando realiza el sexo oral “se siente más liberada y con mayor poder”. El estudio también demostró que la decisión de ellas en no recibirlo se debió a la percepción negativa que tienen los hombres con los genitales femeninos. La investigación publicada en el Journal of Sex Research enfatizó que los hombres se niegan a realizarle sexo oral a su pareja porque lo tildan como de “mal gusto”. Para llegar a esta conclusión, los investigadores encuestaron a 71 personas de ambos géneros entre las edades de 16 y 18 años. La mayoría estuvo de acuerdo que existía desigualdad en el dar y recibir. Tanto los hombres como las mujeres estuvieron de acuerdo que los genitales femeninos eran más “desagradables”, y que es un “asunto muy grande” que ellos quisieran realizar sexo oral a su pareja.

Wenn es um die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter geht, herrscht auch in den Schlafzimmern noch ganz schön viel Nachholbedarf. Und das, wie pikant, speziell beim Oralsex, wie nun eine neue Studie (veröffentlicht in The Journal of Sex Research ) an der University of the Pacific zeigt. Ruth Lewis und Cicely Marston, beide Soziologinnen, fanden heraus, dass sowohl Männer als auch Frauen Cunnilingus als weitaus größeres Ding betrachten, als Fellatio. Der Hauptgrund dafür: die anhaltend negative Wahrnehmung weiblicher Genitalien – und zwar aus Sicht beider Geschlechter. Der \"schwierige\" Cunnilingus Für die Studie wurden 71 heterosexuelle Frauen und Männer zwischen 16 und 18 Jahren zu Ihrer Meinung, Oralsex betreffend, befragt. Es zeigte sich, dass die jungen Menschen sehr widersprüchliche Assoziationen und Ideen zu diesem Thema hatten. Abgesehen davon, dass Cunnilingus als heikler empfunden wird, wird er auch von beiden Geschlechtern als widerlicher eingeordnet, im Vergleich zu Fellatio. Sowohl die jungen Frauen als auch die jungen Männern vertraten die Meinung, dass der Oralsex beim Mann üblicher und einfacher wäre. Dazu kommt, dass sich viele Männer im Rahmen der Studie nicht nur negativ zu Cunnilingus äußerten, sondern ganz allgemein über das weibliche Geschlechtsorgan. Die Vagina wurde als ekelhaft beschrieben. Von solchen Bildern und negativem Feedback sind die Frauen indirekt in ihrer Selbstwahrnehmung betroffen: Viele Frauen empfinden sich als unschön und haben Angst, sich und ihre Vulva zu exponieren. Auch, was die Bereitschaft zu Oralsex angeht, gibt es starke Geschlechterunterschiede: Während die jungen Männer – vorwiegend aus dem Großraum London, übrigens – zugaben, dass sie in Stimmung sein müssten, um Oralsex an ihren Sexpartnerinnen zu praktizieren, tendieren junge Frauen dazu, es trotzdem zu tun – auch wenn ihnen gar nicht danach ist. Viele der jungen Frauen beschrieben sogar Strategien, um diese Erfahrung erträglicher zu machen. Bereits im Jahr 2015 zeigte eine ähnliche Studie den signifikanten Oralsex-Unterschied zwischen Männern und Frauen. Frauen sind mehr als doppelt so oft bereit, ihre Partner oral zu befriedigen als umgekehrt. Die Autoren der Studie sind sich einig, dass das Problem u.a. in der falschen Sexualerziehung wurzele:“ Es wäre wichtig, Sexualerziehung nicht nur an Themen wie „Krankheit“ oder „Schwangerschaftsverhütung“ festzumachen, sondern auch, wie man einander auf gleicher Augenhöhe begegnet und wechselseitig Gutes tut.

Si l’évolution des moeurs tente d’aboutir à l’égalité des sexes, le combat est encore long… Les inégalités persistent encore lorsqu’on parle de sexe oral. Une étude, menée par l’université anglaise Pacific et de l’école londonienne d’Hygiène et de Médecine Tropicale, publiée dans la revue scientifique Journal of Sex Research, s’est penchée sur la manière dont les jeunes anglais définissaient et considéraient le sex oral. Les chercheurs ont interrogé 71 hommes et femmes âgées de 16 à 18 ans, et les ont retrouvés un an après, pour évaluer les potentiels changements sur leur rapport au sexe oral. Le cunnilingus : un enjeu pour les hommes Même si ils considèrent que « l’égalité sexuelle » est importante, une majorité de jeunes décrit le cunnilingus comme un « enjeu ». A l’inverse, la fellation reste pour les sondés un acte plus systématiquement réalisé. En clair : plus évident. Pratiquer le sexe oral serait plus « désagréable » pour l’homme que pour la femme. « Beaucoup de recherches ont été faites sur les relations vaginales, mais nous ne connaissions que très peu les attentes et expériences des jeunes sur les pratiques orales, confie Ruth Lewis. Cette recherche nous a permis d’avoir une idée sur la manière dont les jeunes considèrent les pratiques orales ». Les femmes sont plus conciliantes Les jeunes intervenants ont évoqué la manière dont les hommes parlaient du sexe féminin. Les connotations négatives priment. Du coup, conscientes de ces remarques, les jeunes femmes seraient plus partagées sur leur désir d'avoir un cunnilingus. Toujours selon l'étude, les jeunes hommes sont très nombreux à assumer leur refus de pratiquer un cunnilingus, notamment par dégout. Les femmes, elles, sont plus susceptibles de faire une fellation pour faire plaisir à leur parteanire. Selon Ruth Lewis, il serait donc urgent de sensibiliser les jeunes à l’importance de l’égalité sexuelle. « L’éducation sexuelle devrait couvrir plus de sujets que ceux sur la grossesse et les maladies sexuellement transmissibles. Elle devrait développer l’esprit critique des adolescents quant à l’image que la société véhicule du corps féminin et masculin, la nuance entre consentement et contrainte etc…». Il reste donc beaucoup de travail à faire.","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5103506"}]}

Det skriver University of the Pacific ifølge Videnskab.dk.

Det her var et udforskende studie, der skulle give os en idé om, hvordan unge mennesker taler om oralsex, siger Ruth Lewis, der er sociolog ved University of the Pacific i Californien, USA, som har stået bag studiet, i en pressemeddelelse. Artiklen fortsætter under annoncen Læs også på Videnskab.dk: Gymnasiepiger er porno-glade Interviewene afslørede også, at mændenes sprog om kvindernes kønsdele ofte var nedladende, samt at kvinder ofte havde splittede følelser omkring at modtage oralsex, fordi de var bevidste om netop dette. Ifølge Ruth Lewis viser studiets resultater, at der er brug for større fokus på dynamikker mellem kønnene i seksualundervisningen. - Seksualundervisning bør ikke kun handle om graviditet og kønssygdomme. Det er tydeligt, at vi også er nødt til opmuntre unge mennesker til at tænke kritisk omkring, hvordan mænd og kvinders kroppe bliver omtalt i samfundet, nuancerne ved samtykke og tvang, samt hvordan ligestilling kan finde sted i praksis, siger hun, skriver Videnskab.dk.

The superficial femininity or masculinity of male scientists, by contrast, was not related to observers' judgments about the likelihood that they were scientists. For both male and female scientists, those considered more attractive were thought less likely to be a scientist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe findings come from two studies that involved over 250 people, recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk survey website, looking at smiling headshots of 80 men and women scientists taken from the webpages of elite US science labs. The participants did not know the origin of the photos and thought they were taking part in a study of first impressions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe results, published in \u003ci\u003eSex Roles\u003c/i\u003e, echo real-life events \u0026ndash; last year an advertising campaign by the tech company OneLogin faced accusations of fakery after some people found it unbelievable that their feminine-looking software engineer \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.1ayntsand\"\u003eIsis Anchalee\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; who featured in the campaign \u0026ndash; was the real deal.

Is there enough to say about science communication to sustain a blog? And, if so, who would want to read about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudging from the existence of annual conferences that focus on various aspects of science communication (e.g., \u003ca href=\"http://scienceonline.com/\"\u003eScienceOnline\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencewriters2012.org/\"\u003eNational Association of Science Writers\u003c/a\u003e), there is a lot to discuss when it comes to science communication. I plan to write about a wide range of these issues on this blog, including social media, science outreach and working with reporters. I also plan on recruiting guest posts from experts in a variety of fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be running this blog with two audiences in mind: researchers who are interested in the nuts and bolts of how to communicate about science, and professional communicators – including reporters and public information officers (or flacks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy way of background, I’m including a list of links to some of the posts I’ve written for other blogs – and which helped me land this gig in the first place: \u003ca title=\"What Scientists, Science Writers and PIOs Should Expect from Each Other\" href=\"http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2012/01/31/what-scientists-science-writers-and-pios-should-expect-from-each-other\"\u003eWhat Scientists, Science Writers and PIOs Should Expect from Each Other\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca title=\"Writing About Science, When You\u0026#39;re Not a Scientist\" href=\"http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2012/02/28/the-promise-pitfalls-of-public-outreach-part-2-writing-about-science-when-youre-not-a-scientist\"\u003eWriting About Science, When You’re Not A Scientist\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca title=\"Social Media: Taking Science to the People\" href=\"http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2012/03/14/the-promise-pitfalls-of-public-outreach-part-3-social-media-taking-science-to-the-people\"\u003eSocial Media: Taking Science To The People\u003c/a\u003e; and \u003ca title=\"Why Scientists Should Publicize Their Findings - for Purely Selfish Reasons\" href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/06/18/why-scientists-should-publicize-their-findings-for-purely-selfish-reasons/\"\u003eWhy Scientists Should Publicize Their Findings – for Purely Selfish Reasons\u003c/a\u003e.

That definitely includes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I’ll be sharing my thoughts and opinions on a variety of issues, I am well aware that I do not have all the answers – and some of the answers I think I have are probably wrong.

I hope you benefit from my experience in the field, but I also want to learn from you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I’m just getting started, here’s a question I’m really hoping you’ll answer: What science communication issues do you want to talk about?\u003c/p\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5110616"},{"$numberLong":"723480"}]}

I was looking Hollywood . While walking back to work, I got stopped by a male on the street asking me where I thought a good place to start a fitness center in Seattle would be. Odd, but I gave him honest advice about which areas I thought he could investigate (turns out he was using it as a pick up line to ask me to dinner, but thats a whole other tangent). He then asked me if I worked for Amazon (since the area I worked is the home base mecca) and I said, \"Hell no! I'm a scientist.\" His word for word response: \"OH! I wouldn't have expected that! Do they take you seriously with all that makeup and your hair done?\" I told him I had been in a photoshoot and I'm not sure if he was trying to flatter me or what, but I should have said, \"Ya, and they even pay me to think!\" \n\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0586-1","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5110616"}]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"112337760"},"body":"\u003cp\u003eThree years ago I began working with teachers in an intensive externship. Over three-week periods, they would train alongside me every day, developing lesson plans for classrooms based on my research. One of my teachers, not expecting me to look the way I did, called me fancy. The name stuck as I am now @FancyScientist on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/FancyScientist\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fancy_scientist/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing fancy in science is rare, especially in my field of ecology where the common attire is T-shirts and field pants, even at professional conferences. In fact, there seems to be an inverse relationship in attire; the more accomplished you are in your career, the less dressed up you are, presumably because you are so busy with your science, that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less what you look like. Across the board, stereotypes of scientists are nerdy white men in lab coats. So when this teacher saw me every day with make-up and jewelry on, she was taken aback, and I was given my name. I get the same reaction from students when I visit classrooms. Some times when I wait in the back of the room before I am introduced, students think I am an assistant or substitute teacher, and not the visiting scientist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure data-shortcode=\"caption\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/me2.jpg?w=428\u0026amp;h=346\" alt=\"me2\" width=\"428\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/me2.jpg?w=428\u0026amp;h=346 428w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/me2.jpg?w=856\u0026amp;h=692 856w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/me2.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=121 150w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/me2.jpg?w=400\u0026amp;h=323 400w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/me2.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=621 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMe visiting a classroom.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor these reasons, I found this \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293045096_But_You_Don%27t_Look_Like_A_Scientist_Women_Scientists_with_Feminine_Appearance_are_Deemed_Less_Likely_to_be_Scientists\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecent study\u003c/a\u003e to be completely unsurprising. When people were asked to judge photos of real female scientists on what they thought their career was, women who were more feminine-looking, were less likely guessed to be a scientist. So who cares? Maybe people are just bad at guessing women\u0026rsquo;s careers. Seemingly benign, the results reveal some societal perceptions with important implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the study, the authors cite several studies that support the notion that people are attracted to careers where they feel they belong and are similar to others. STEM-careers are already dominated by men, which likely deters women alone, and if there is an underlying perception that women must not be feminine or have to act a certain way, women\u0026rsquo;s interest may be further dampened. \u0026nbsp;In other words, they are afraid of being judged. I have personally felt this judgement, whether it was real or perceived, that because I looked a certain way, people didn\u0026rsquo;t take me seriously or think I was smart. When I first began in my career, at professional meetings, I would actually tone down my appearance, dressing down (but surprisingly still dressier than most other people), avoid wearing heels, and limit make-up. I fit in more, but I was a sad panda. And I still felt judgement. While make-up and heels are frivolous, those things truly make life much more fun for me and taking them away wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowing me to be my best self. After about a year of doing this, I decided I didn\u0026rsquo;t care anymore and started embracing my old and authentic self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I have not suffered consequences for my appearance (to my knowledge), the consequences are definitely there. Nobel-winning scientist Sir Tim Hunt got in huge trouble for saying this about women in the lab: \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/europe/tim-hunt-nobel-laureate-resigns-sexist-women-female-scientists.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026rdquo; In response, female scientists tweeted out photos of them in dirty field clothes and hazmat suits saying they were \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33099289\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#distractinglysexy\u003c/a\u003e, ridiculing Hunt\u0026rsquo;s remarks. Yet the reality of the situation is that most female scientists on most days do not go to work looking like this. You pretty much dress normal. Hunt\u0026rsquo;s remarks revealed it is difficult for him to have female scientists in the lab, because of sexual undertones. I wonder how many male professors feel the same as Hunt, yet are not vocal enough say it. In such a case, a feminine appearance, or feminine styles of dress may not get you a job. In fact, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293045096_But_You_Don%27t_Look_Like_A_Scientist_Women_Scientists_with_Feminine_Appearance_are_Deemed_Less_Likely_to_be_Scientists\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBanchefsky et al. 2016 \u003c/a\u003estudy discusses other studies where women report feeling unable to present themselves in a stereotypically feminine manner because they will be perceived as unsuitable for a STEM career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if science is not feminine-friendly, why not just conform? I already mentioned that I myself would be sad, but there are also consequences beyond. When little kids are asked, \u0026ldquo;what do you want to be when you grow up?\u0026rdquo; like it or not, they are using societal perceptions to construct visions of themselves. To a young girl potentially interested in a STEM career, if she doesn\u0026rsquo;t see anyone that looks like her or that \u003ca href=\"https://wildlifesnpits.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/go-science-attracting-girls-to-stem-careers-with-sparkles/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshares her interests\u003c/a\u003e, she may doubt her abilities to pursue that career. She might not even know that that this career is even available to her. Imagine Bill Nye and I walking into a classroom. Who do you think the girls are going to relate more to? Other studies show that presenting role models that challenge STEM stereotypes does increase interest in STEM (\u003ca href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/athena-swan/Culturalstereotypes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheryan et al. 2012\u003c/a\u003e). Therefore, in order to have a diverse STEM workforce, you need to show a diverse STEM workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subtext behind all of this is that STEM careers are perceived of as being hard, and you can\u0026rsquo;t be pretty and smart. Make-up and jewelry are frivolous and a great mind should not be wasted on them. In addition to staying true to myself, I chose to play into my femininity as a rebellion to this stigma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_5423.jpg?w=366\u0026amp;h=458\" alt=\"IMG_5423\" width=\"366\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_5423.jpg?w=366\u0026amp;h=458 366w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_5423.jpg?w=732\u0026amp;h=916 732w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_5423.jpg?w=120\u0026amp;h=150 120w, https://wildlifesnpits.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_5423.jpg?w=320\u0026amp;h=400 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wildlifesnpits.wordpress.com/3360/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wildlifesnpits.wordpress.com/3360/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wildlifesnpits.wordpress.com\u0026amp;blog=57076599\u0026amp;post=3360\u0026amp;subd=wildlifesnpits\u0026amp;ref=\u0026amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5110616"}]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"96893841"},"body":"A nationally representative study with a sample of 2,700 British young adults reveals that how sexually competent you are the first time you have sex has major implications for your future #sexlife. In this study, being “sexually competent” at first sex was defined as using #contraception, making an autonomous decision to have sex, equal willingness from both partners, and having sex at the “right time.” A lack of sexual competence was associated for both sexes with testing positive for #HPV at the time of the interview and low #sexualfunction in the past year. For women only, lack of sexual competence was also associated with ever being diagnosed with #STIs, having an #unplannedpregnancy in the past year, and ever experiencing nonvolitional sex. The takeaway? Being mature enough to have sex is dependent less on chronological age than on contextual factors like competence.\n#legitsexscience #sexscience #sexresearch #sexsciencenews #khanscope\nLink to study: ow.ly/YQNye","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"5701431"}]}

Much of the focus is\u0026nbsp;on\u0026nbsp;their clothing style or physical size and they are often portrayed as \u0026ldquo;thugs,\u0026rdquo; deserving of whatever violence that befalls them. The fatal shootings of boys like Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, and Trayvon Martin garnered widespread attention to this perceived dangerousness of African-American boys. Despite better access to economic resources, many middle- and upper-class Black mothers fear they cannot adequately prepare their sons for the gendered racism likely to pervade nearly every aspect of their social lives.

Mothers\u0026rsquo; incomes ranged from $50,000 to $300,000 and 63% held advanced degrees.\u0026nbsp;Dow found that middle \u0026ndash; and upper-class Black m\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eothers employ multiple strategies to combat negative stereotypes about their sons.

Others use \u0026ldquo;environment management,\u0026rdquo; such as moving to predominantly white neighborhoods or limiting their son\u0026rsquo;s interactions with other neighborhood kids in order to curb the amount of discrimination they face in certain social settings. Mothers also teach their sons how to engage in \u0026ldquo;image and emotion management\u0026rdquo; by prohibiting certain styles of dress and telling them not to show frustration and anger. The mothers Dow interviewed\u0026nbsp;saw these techniques as essential in navigating the \u0026ldquo;thug\u0026rdquo; image and keeping their children safe from the discrimination of teachers and the brutality of law enforcement.\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan\u003e Black mothers of all economic backgrounds use stigma management to try and keep their sons safe, whether it be teaching them to manage their environment, their experiences, or their emotions. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDow\u0026rsquo;s findings suggest that while middle- and upper-class mothers acknowledge additional resources afforded by their socioeconomic status, they believe their sons are\u0026nbsp;still treated poorly by educators and law enforcement officials because of their racial identity and gender. As a result, Black mothers of all economic backgrounds use stigma management to try and keep their sons safe, whether it be teaching them to manage their environment, their experiences, or their emotions.\u0026nbsp;With all the work Black mothers and their sons are doing to keep Black boys safe, here\u0026rsquo;s hoping others start putting in some effort too.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6009801"}]}

Dawn Marie Dow\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243216629928\"\u003earticle\u003c/a\u003e in \u003cem\u003eGender \u0026amp; Society\u003c/em\u003e examines how mothers encourage their sons to express their racial identity and masculinity. Specifically, her study explores how the controlling image of the \u0026ldquo;thug\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;a form of subordinate masculinity\u0026mdash;influences African-American middle- and upper-middle-class mothers\u0026rsquo; parenting concerns and practices with sons. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDow interviewed 60 middle- and upper-middle-class African-American mothers. Despite having more resources afforded to them than lower-income mothers, their sons still experienced gendered racism, such as being overly disciplined in school.  Emphasizing the fluidity that is required to protect black male bodies and manage their vulnerability in different contexts, Dow finds mothers engage in several parenting strategies. Mothers attempted to control their sons\u0026rsquo; social interactions through \u003cem\u003eexperience\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eenvironment management\u003c/em\u003e, and they tried to regulate their sons\u0026rsquo; appearance through emotion and image management. The goal of experience management is to gain fluency moving between communities that differ by class, race, and gender. Mothers engaged in environment management by attempting to shield their sons from arenas expected to produce discrimination, such as particular teams, clubs, or neighborhoods. Explicitly confronting the \u0026ldquo;thug\u0026rdquo; image, participants reported using emotion and image management to reduce their sons\u0026rsquo; vulnerability. For instance, they taught their sons strategies for interacting with authority figures such as teachers and police officers and encouraged them to restrain expressions of anger or excitement that could be interpreted as aggressive or violent. Race, class, and gender all weigh heavy on the minds of minority mothers all-too-aware of the dangers their sons face as young, Black men. \u003c/p\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6009801"}]}

On ne parle pas ici de gens qui ont des troubles mentaux, mais qui vivent une sexualité entre adultes consentants derrière des portes closes. Or, leur intérêt sexuel se retrouve, écrit noir sur blanc, dans un manuel de diagnostics en psychiatrie. Ça crée chez eux de la détresse, divers sexologues l’ont noté. Étiqueter comme anormaux des intérêts sexuels légaux peut être lourd de conséquences. » Sophie Allard La Presse « La sexualité, c’est 50 nuances de gris, illustre M. Joyal. Elle s’exerce dans un continuum dont on ne fait pas état dans le DSM-5. Il ne faut pas confondre le trouble mental et le comportement paraphilique. En cour, les avocats et les juges feront-ils la différence ? » Il explique : « Il y a présence de trouble psychologique seulement si le comportement sexuel est associé à une souffrance et un mal-être, s’il y a une fixité et une rigidité. » La récurrence, l’intensité et l’illégalité sont aussi à considérer. « Si on pratique le sadomasochisme avec un partenaire consentant le samedi, une fois de temps en temps, où est le problème ? » Sophie Allard La Presse Jusqu’à 44,5 % de la population exprime des fantasmes sexuels impliquant l’érotisation d’un objet ou d’une partie du corps, selon l’étude québécoise. Les femmes (47,9 %) ont davantage de désirs fétichistes que les hommes (40,4 %), même si ces derniers sont plus nombreux à expérimenter la pratique : 30,1 % des hommes contre 23,2 % des femmes. Parmi tous les répondants, le tiers (30,1 %) a déjà vécu un épisode d’exhibitionnisme en couple, tandis que le quart (26,1 %) a expérimenté le frotteurisme (recherche de contacts physiques avec des personnes non consentantes). Sophie Allard La Presse Presque deux fois plus de femmes (23,7 %) que d’hommes (13,9 %) ont déjà fait l’expérience du masochisme. Une femme sur quatre (27,8 %) a des fantasmes de soumission. « On peut penser à un effet négatif de la pornographie, dans laquelle la femme est habituellement soumise, mais ce n’est pas si simple, dit Christian Joyal. Les femmes qui ont des fantasmes de soumission sont de loin celles qui sont les plus satisfaites de leur vie sexuelle. On voit aussi une corrélation presque parfaite entre le niveau d’éducation et la diversité des pratiques sexuelles. Est-ce donc anormal ? » Sophie Allard La Presse Puisque plusieurs attirances et pratiques sexuelles licites ne sont « ni rares ni inhabituelles », Christian Joyal est d’avis que le DSM-5 fait fausse route en les jugeant anormales. « On tente très malhabilement de définir la normalité des comportements sexuels. Si vous n’entrez pas dans leur petite case et que, de temps en temps, vous avez une attirance ou un comportement atypiques, vous êtes anormaux. Sur quelle base établissent-ils la norme sexuelle ? Ça relève d’un jugement de valeur plutôt que de données probantes. Certains intérêts paraphiliques sont plus communs que l’on croit », dit le chercheur. La perception de la sexualité est malléable et dépend de facteurs socioculturels, dit le chercheur. « Il y a 100 ans, le sexe oral était considéré comme un symptôme dégradant d’un trouble psychologique sévère. Dans les années 50, c’était illégal dans plusieurs États américains. C’est maintenant le fantasme numéro un tant chez les hommes que chez les femmes. » Près du tiers des Québécois ont déjà fait l’expérience d’une pratique sexuelle jugée anormale dans le DSM-5, bible diagnostique des troubles mentaux, comme le masochisme ou le fétichisme. C’est ce que révèle une étude menée par des chercheurs de l’Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montréal, dont les résultats sont publiés dans The Journal of Sex Research. Le DSM-5 serait-il trop prude ?

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"99406890"},"body":"A ]wave of fetish-related Google searches followed the most recent episode of 11.22.63, after a scene introduced a form of masochism involving genitals and a clothespin. It was weird. But how weird was it, really? The holy bible of judgmental psychiatric boards everywhere — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) — defines “paraphilic” sexual interests as unusual or anomalous. But the basis for those judgments isn’t exactly clear. In an article published this week in The Journal of Sex Research, researchers asked: Is something actually unusual if a lot of people do it? To find out, the team from University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres and Philippe Pinel Institute of Montreal took to computer screens and phone lines of Quebec, surveying a sample of 1,040 people. Classified according to factors like age, gender, religious affiliation and education, the group was thought to represent the province’s norms. Voyeurism, classified by the DSM as a paraphilic behavior, is surprisingly common. The researchers probed participants’ interests in the eight paraphilic behaviors listed in the DSM: voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism (touching or rubbing against a non-consenting individual), masochism, sadism, pedophilia, fetishism (technically, using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on non-genital body parts), and transvestic disorder (engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing to the point of distress or harm). Because the authors focused only on the behaviors themselves — not the way in which people engaged in them — it’s especially important to note the difference between a paraphilic behavior and disorder. Paraphilias aren’t considered mental disorders — they’re simply sexual preferences for “unusual” behavior — and paraphilic behavior is only engaged in from time to time. Yet paraphilic disorder, by definition, involves non-consenting partners and causes suffering or confusion. Of all of the random Quebecois surveyed, almost half expressed interest in at least one type of paraphilia, and about one-third had actually acted on those desires at least once. Interest in voyeurism, fetishism, frotteurism, and masochism, in particular, was high enough — at 15.9 percent of both men and women surveyed — to be considered “statistically unusual.” Oddly — or perhaps not — masochism was significantly linked to a more satisfying sex life. Although men were generally more interested in paraphilic behavior than women, the authors point out that women who were interested in sexual submission were actually more drawn to more diverse sexual interests. It’s time to reassess how we define normal and anomalous sexual behaviors, the authors write. Labeling paraphilias as abnormal, when they aren’t in the practical sense, could stigmatize and shame when it’s unnecessary — which is something the DSM has more than enough experience with. Lest readers think the Quebecois are simply a rarefied, sexually liberated bunch, the authors point out that they “have reasons to believe that this study’s results which are based on Quebec’s population can be applied to the population of North America and Europe as well.” Photos via https://www.flickr.com/photos/rundwolf/ and https://www.flickr.com/photos/dekaritae/","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6050273"},{"$numberLong":"6050273"}]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"103026232"},"body":"Voyeurism Almost half of people surveyed have fantasies about voyeurism, or watching a stranger get undressed or have sex. About a third copped to doing this deed. Fetishism About a quarter of respondents confessed they've indulged in fetishism, or being aroused by a nonsexual object like a pair of high heels or a silk scarf. Exhibitionism Thirty percent of people admit to having had sex in public or in an area where there was a high chance of getting seen or caught. Frotteurism Around a quarter of respondents had engaged in something called frotteurism, which is getting turned on by touching or rubbing themselves against a stranger. Masochism Almost 20% of people lived out the fantasy of being sexually aroused by being dominated or humiliated by another (think handcuffs). MORE: Try A New Sex Position Tonight The people surveyed were by no means sexual deviants. \"We'd done past studies in students and weren't shocked that many were experimenting, but this was the first time we looked at the general population,\" Joyal says. And yet, although all of these behaviors seem fairly mainstream, they're still considered abnormal in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association. (Read about what it's like to be in a sexless marriage.) \"All the behaviors we looked at are classified as paraphilic disorders, which is defined as any intense sexual interest that doesn't involve genital stimulation or fondling with your partner,\" says Joyal. \"It's outrageous that people who are tied up or get turned on by having their feet rubbed are classified in the same category as pedophiles.\" Some of these activities, like frotteurism and exhibitionism, are clearly illegal, and no, we don't recommend exposing yourself at Trader Joe's or rubbing up against someone on the subway. But most of the time, these behaviors, as long as they're done between two consenting adults, is healthy and fine, reassures Joyal. (Feeling pain during sex? Here's 8 reasons it hurts during sex and how to fix it.) In fact, Joyal's research suggests that the more so-called kinky sex people admitted to, the happier and more robust their sex life. \"Less than 10% said to us it was a regular practice—otherwise it was something they tried on occasion to spice things up,\" says Joyal. It only becomes a problem, he adds, if either you or your partner feel uncomfortable doing the requested activity, or if it becomes obsessive (for example, needing to look at porn for hours, or insisting on wearing a nurse's outfit every single time you have sex). Otherwise, grab a feather duster, paintbrush, ping-pong paddle, or captain's uniform, and role play away.","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6050273"}]}

Have gender stereotypes changed over this time period to reflect the new realities? And, to what extent does gender stereotyping exist today? We address these questions by comparing data collected in the early 1980s to new data collected in 2014. In each study, participants rated the likelihood that a typical man or woman has a set of gendered characteristics (traits, role behaviors, occupations, and physical characteristics). Results indicate that people perceive strong differences between men and women on stereotype components today, as they did in the past. Comparisons between the two time periods show stability of gender stereotypes across all components except female gender roles, which showed a significant increase in gender stereotyping. These results attest to the durability of basic stereotypes about how men and women are perceived to differ, despite changes in the participation and acceptance of women and men in nontraditional domains. Because gender stereotypes are apparently so deeply embedded in our society, those in a position to evaluate women and men, as well as women and men themselves, need to be constantly vigilant to the possible influence of stereotypes on their judgments, choices, and actions.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[\u003ca href=\"\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/03/03/0361684316634081.abstract\"\u003ehttp://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/03/03/0361684316634081.abstract\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/03/03/0361684316634081.abstract\"\u003ehttp://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/03/03/0361684316634081.abstract\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e☆\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe 1984 Paper:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eStructure of gender stereotypes: Interrelationships among components and gender label\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003eAbstract:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Assessed the extent to which gender label and various types of component information influenced the judgments made by 458 undergraduates in 3 experiments regarding the existence of other gender-related characteristics not specifically implied by the provided information.

In Exp II, 84 male and 92 female Ss followed the previous procedure but were given traits rather than roles of the person. Results show that gender stereotypes consisted of a number of separate components. In Exp III, each of 4 gender stereotype components was presented in a within-Ss design, and 83 male and 88 female Ss made judgments about each component. Results show that information about one stereotype component can implicate other components; specific component information may outweigh gender identification; and components differ in their ability to implicate other components of gender stereotypes, with physical appearance playing a dominant role.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e{\u003ca href=\"\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\"\u003ehttp://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\u003c/a\u003e;id=1984-25799-001\"\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\"\u003ehttp://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\u003c/a\u003e;id=1984-25799-001\u003c/a\u003e}﻿ Depressing Study Finds Gender Stereotypes Haven’t Changed Since the 1980s Fun! \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/depressing-study-finds-gender-stereotypes-havent-changed-since-the-1980s.html\"\u003ehttp://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/depressing-study-finds-gender-stereotypes-havent-changed-since-the-1980s.html\u003c/a\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6147115"}]}

In Exp I, 42 male and 65 female undergraduates were given gender and role information about a person and asked to estimate the probability that the person had a number of other characteristics or engaged in a number of other behaviors. In Exp II, 84 male and 92 female Ss followed the previous procedure but were given traits rather than roles of the person. Results show that gender stereotypes consisted of a number of separate components. In Exp III, each of 4 gender stereotype components was presented in a within-Ss design, and 83 male and 88 female Ss made judgments about each component. Results show that information about one stereotype component can implicate other components; specific component information may outweigh gender identification; and components differ in their ability to implicate other components of gender stereotypes, with physical appearance playing a dominant role.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e{\u003ca href=\"\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\"\u003ehttp://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\u003c/a\u003e;id=1984-25799-001\"\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\"\u003ehttp://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy\u0026amp\u003c/a\u003e;id=1984-25799-001\u003c/a\u003e}﻿ Depressing Study Finds Gender Stereotypes Haven’t Changed Since the 1980s Fun! \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/depressing-study-finds-gender-stereotypes-havent-changed-since-the-1980s.html\"\u003ehttp://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/depressing-study-finds-gender-stereotypes-havent-changed-since-the-1980s.html\u003c/a\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6147115"}]}

Women are much less likely to be \u003cem\u003etold\u003c/em\u003e that they don't belong in the lab, and people may be less likely to believe that they don't. But both men \u003cem\u003eand women\u003c/em\u003e are influenced by \u003ca href=\"http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/\"\u003eimplicit biases\u003c/a\u003e \u0026mdash; stereotypes and associations that can subtly and unconsciously influence their decisions and evaluations regarding others and themselves. For instance, one recent \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1314788111\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e found that both male and female participants were twice as likely to select a man over a woman to complete a mathematical task, even when they had no evidence that the man would perform the task better.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eAnother \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361684316630965\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e, published earlier this year, found that both male and female undergraduates were more likely to explain a woman's science-related setback than a man's by appeal to factors about that person (e.g., \"Lisa was 'let go' from her research assistant job because she messed up an experiment\"). The reverse pattern was true for men's setbacks \u0026mdash; the undergraduates were more likely to explain them by appeal to factors about the situation (e.g., \"Steve was 'let go' from his research assistant job because there were budget cuts\").\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eThese examples of implicit bias may seem inconsequential, but they're only two among dozens, and they add up over the course of an individual's education and career.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eA second reason contemporary challenges for women may go unnoticed is because they're often not a consequence of sex or gender identity per se, but instead an interaction between caregiving responsibilities and the structure of the workplace. Women with children, in particular, suffer from what some have dubbed a \"\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty\"\u003emotherhood penalty\u003c/a\u003e,\" with negative effects on income, career advancement, and perceived competence relative to both fathers and women without children. Caregiving responsibilities can lead women to favor jobs with greater flexibility (which typically come with lower pay and fewer opportunities for career advancement), to forego professionally valuable travel, and to pass up opportunities that could involve relocation when it doesn't work well for their families. These systematic costs for women are a function of gender-based caregiving norms and aspects of the workplace that should arguably change, but they don't necessarily reflect discrimination against \u003cem\u003ewomen\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eFinally, people may assume that the number of women entering the science \"pipeline\" is an indication of the future; that women are underrepresented at higher ranks due to past \u0026mdash; not present \u0026mdash; barriers. For instance, the American Institute of Physics \u003ca href=\"https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/faculty/womenfac-pa-10.pdf\"\u003ereports\u003c/a\u003e that in 2010, the percentage of physics faculty members who were women was 22 percent at the assistant professor level, 15 percent at the associate professor level, and only 8 percent at the full professor level. This could reflect an effect of age: The full professors (on average) entered physics at a time when women faced more serious discrimination than that faced by women a few years later, when the associate professors were entering the field, and so on. By this logic, achieving gender parity at the undergraduate level solves the problem.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this idea isn't backed by the data.

Moreover, experimental exposure to this content in the laboratory leads both women and men to have a diminished view of women’s competence, morality, and humanity. The takeaway?

There is far less discussion about gender-based violence against men and young boys. In a recently published paper, \u003ca href=\"https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/ferrales\"\u003eGabrielle Ferrales\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://sociology.osu.edu/people/brehm.84\"\u003eHollie Nyseth Brehm\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/mave0013\"\u003eSuzy McElrath\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;shed light on this understudied phenomenon and explore sexual violence against males in Darfur. The authors explain that, although this violence is in some ways about physical domination, it is primarily meant to symbolically dominate and denigrate both the victims and surviving community members. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e Using interview data from the Atrocities Documentation Survey (ADS), the authors analyse 1,136 Darfuri interviews conducted in Eastern Chad. The authors examine how gender-based violence against men and boys works to emasculate them through homosexualization, feminization, genital harm, and sex-selective killing. This allows perpetrators to perform masculinity in a manner that is in line with the Sudan\u0026rsquo;s gender norms, and\u0026nbsp;points to the role that gender plays in influencing patterns of violence. In addition, emasculation allows for a symbolic form of violence to be perpetrated. One such symbolic form of violence is the degradation of males in both this life and the afterlife. This often occurs through post-mortem rape, serving to violate not just burial norms but also ensuring that the victim\u0026rsquo;s standing is tarnished even in the afterlife.\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan\u003eAlthough this violence is in some ways about physical domination, it is primarily meant to symbolically dominate and denigrate both the victims and surviving community members.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThese findings shed light not only on how sexual violence is perpetrated against men during mass atrocities, but it can also contribute to our understanding of gender-based violence \u003cem\u003eoutside\u003c/em\u003e of these extreme circumstances.

{"_id":10520943,"body":"\u003cp\u003eIrrespective of the reason for being an adult virgin, new research coming from \u003cem\u003eThe Kinsey Institute\u003c/em\u003e indicates that it can be tough in the modern day, thanks to a m\u0026eacute;nage \u0026agrave; trois of negative stigma and discrimination coming from more experienced adults, other adult virgins, and themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a virgin until married, not so many moons ago, was regarded near enough the world over as a symbol of purity and respectability, and premarital sex was typically shunned. But today in Western societies in particular, premarital sex in adolescence is generally the norm. Yet an approximate minimum of 1.1 million American men and 800,000 women between 25 and 45 years old characterize as heterosexual virgins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three studies, published in \u003cem\u003eThe Journal of Sex Research\u003c/em\u003e, assessed perceptions of, and attitudes toward, heterosexual adult virgins \u0026mdash; defined as the absence of experiencing vaginal penetrative intercourse. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudy 1: Virgins and non-virgins perceptions of stigma \u0026amp; discrimination\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudy 1 involved a survey of 560 heterosexual American adults revealing that 141 participants were virgins (25.2%; 79 women, 62 men), with an age range of 18 to 52 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncorporating a \u003ca href=\"http://brainblogger.com/2012/04/11/the-company-you-keep-social-and-associative-stigmas/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estigma \u003c/a\u003eassessment scale in the survey also revealed that adult virgins feel more stigmatized for being a virgin than non-virgin\u0026rsquo;s feel stigmatized for being sexually experienced, irrespective of if they had 8 or 38 previous sexual partners. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis suggests that relative to non-virgins, being a virgin feels less like a social blessing and more like a social curse. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudy 2: Virgin discrimination in the form of limited serious relationship opportunities \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA U.S. nationally representative sample of 4,934 single, heterosexual adults (21-76+ years old) were asked: How likely are you to consider getting into a committed relationship with someone who is a virgin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response? Chances look slim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a low likelihood of considering getting into a relationship with a virgin across all participants, yet particularly with: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eyounger participants (particularly women)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esexually experienced participants (particularly men)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003evirgins themselves (particularly women)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e Seeing as participants in the same situation of relative inexperience discriminate against other virgins, the authors suggested that relationship opportunities for sexually inexperienced adults may be pretty limited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelatedly, another study found that women experience more sexual \u003ca href=\"http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/01/sex-addiction-defining-the-subtypes-of-hypersexuality-disorder/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eguilt \u003c/a\u003ecompared to men, with levels of guilt increasing the more religious the woman is. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flip side, by process of elimination, one could loosely hypothesize that those most likely to enter a long-term heterosexual relationship with an adult virgin may be older virgin males or older sexually experienced females, cougars some might say.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudy 3: Less discrimination observed on online dating websites\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reduce bias, 353 heterosexual young adults aged 18 to 26 were misled into thinking they were helping test a new online dating website. Each participant was presented with a single \u003ca href=\"http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/14/valentime-who-makes-you-click/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eonline dating\u003c/a\u003e profile that included the usual demographics and personality profile. Additionally, the only notable varying item viewed from participant to participant was level bars that indicated how romantically or sexually experienced the potential match was. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe participants were then asked what they thought about their potential as a partner with a series of questions. A few findings emerged: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSexually experienced participants found both experienced and inexperienced potential dates equally attractive.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVirgins found a sexually inexperienced participant more attractive than those with more experience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving greater romantic experience did not influence the effects that sexual experience has on datability. Nonetheless romantic experience was an important factor in evaluating partners.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in relation to the second study, when asked about a virgin\u0026rsquo;s potential as a partner in a serious committed relationship, virgins were not considered popular by both non-virgins and virgins. But in this study, in the context of rating a potential date on an online dating website, being a virgin doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to register on the radar and actually attracts virgins? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could simply be that generally, online dating websites are more increasingly viewed as a path leading to sexually orientated, yet noncomitant, experiences or a quick route to a one night stand or fling. Indeed, research has shown this is particularly true for the young Tinder-savvy adult generation, like the participants in this experiment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may imply that flings with virgins via online dating are considered more likely than a committed relationship is. However, the way responses to the questionnaire were manipulated in the experiment does not allow the assessment of this, and further research is required to get a more detailed understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough other research indicates it is possible for one to have too much sexual experience, the study in question indicates that adult virginity is linked with social stigma and discrimination, where virgins are considered as less desirable partners in committed intimate relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion the authors suggest that: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause intimate relationships are essential to wellbeing, especially across the adult life course, it seems that being a late bloomer with sexual debut could lower chances of healthy  intimate relationship development even when one is open to such relationships and thereby have a negative impact on wellbeing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReferences\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbbott, E., \u0026amp; Abbott, E.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"99992642"},"body":"Has #virginity lost its virtue? A new study finds that (heterosexual adult) virgins perceive themselves to be stigmatized due to their sexual inexperience and are deemed undesirable relationship partners--even among themselves. The study, which had a sample size of about 1,400, found huge variability in virgins’ age--some virgins were as young as 18, and others were as old as 52. And yet, whether people are simply #latebloomers or abstinent for life, being a virgin has the same negative interpersonal consequences.\n#legitsexscience #sexscience #sexresearch #sexsciencenews #khanscope\nLink to study: ow.ly/ZXyYo\nJoin me on #periscope soon to discuss: periscope.tv/drzhana","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6205089"}]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"100104174"},"body":"A new study on #fakingit finds that young men who’ve feigned #orgasm at least once with their current relationship partner admit to doing so in 25% of their sexual encounters. This study, which had a sample of 230 men ages 18-29, found that faking orgasm was most common during vaginal sex, and that the reasons for doing so, and the amount of sexual satisfaction experienced afterward, varied. When the reason for faking it was due to poor sexual experience or poor partner choice (the strongest predictor), links were observed with lower levels of desire and sexual and relationship satisfaction. But when the reason was to support a partner's emotional well-being, links were observed with higher levels of desire. Other reasons for feigning orgasm that were linked to higher levels of sexual satisfaction? Being drunk, having undesired sex, and wanting to improve the quality of the sex. The takeaway: It’s not just ladies, and it’s not always bad!\n#legitsexscience #sexscience #sexresearch #sexsciencenews #khanscope\nLink to study: ow.ly/ZXyYo","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6205089"}]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"119347831"},"body":"\u003cp\u003eWhen I explain my research to people, they often ask: \u0026ldquo;What is a men\u0026rsquo;s salon, exactly?\u0026rdquo;In a fleeting interaction I might simply describe it as a salon dedicated to the primping and preening of men. The high-service men\u0026rsquo;s salons in my study tout stylish haircuts, fine manicures, exfoliating facials, and meticulous waxing services. But to more accurately explain what a men\u0026rsquo;s salon is involves understanding that gender is actively produced, not a static characteristic of a person or place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my article, \u003ca href=\"http://gas.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/03/21/0891243216637827.abstract\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Men Wanted\u0026rdquo;: Heterosexual Aesthetic Labor in the Masculinization of the Hair Salon\u003c/a\u003e, I tackle the organizational efforts that make the salon an \u0026ldquo;appropriate\u0026rdquo; place for well-to-do, straight, and often white men. This is significant since the salon is historically associated with women and seems an unlikely place in which men can approximate culturally valorized forms masculinity. One way both salons in my study masculinize the space is by demanding what I call\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eheterosexual aesthetic labor\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;from the mostly women workers. Aesthetic labor highlights the importance of workers\u0026rsquo; appearances and use of their body in frontline service work, where employees interact face-to-face with customers. Workers are hired because they embody the aesthetic values of a retail brand, with white, middle-class workers, for example, reflecting the identities of white, middle-class consumers. This assures consumers they are in the \u0026ldquo;right place\u0026rdquo; for people like them and is a key mechanism in reproducing social differences and inequalities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"http://www.thesalon1.net/virtual-salon-tour/\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://thesocietypages.org/feminist/files/2016/10/mens-salon-600x400.jpg\" width=\"600\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage Source: http://www.thesalon1.net/virtual-salon-tour/\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we look at retail organizations and brands, though, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t overlook the role of sexuality in aesthetic labor. This is clear in my fieldnotes and interviews with the employees and clients at both salons. These data reveal that the organizations hire heterosexual, feminine looking women to act as identity resources for men\u0026rsquo;s momentary projections of straight masculinity, which might otherwise come under suspicion at the salon. I show how the organizations I studied hire straight, conventionally feminine women, develop these women\u0026rsquo;s appearances, and use them to represent the salons\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;brands.\u0026rdquo; For example, Trish, a 29-year-old massage therapist, and the only queer identifying participant in my study, was acutely aware that the salon employs pretty straight women:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know how I got the job. I had longer hair then, that\u0026rsquo;s probably why. [Tyler, the owner,] didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was queer then. But he definitely wants to know if they\u0026rsquo;re cute\u0026hellip; Tyler definitely hires pretty girls, for sure. And if you show up without makeup on, he\u0026rsquo;ll be mad.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrish sees herself as having slipped through the cracks of otherwise consistent hiring criteria that conflates long hair and makeup with straight womanhood. These women appear on postcards and in commercials, while the few men who cut hair at these places are absent from marketing efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike sexy women hired at Hooters and who appear on the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s billboards for hot wings, the women working at my salons serve the corporate function of combatting narrow, culturally entrenched ideas about\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ewho\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003egoes to high-service salons: women and gay men. And this is indeed work for women, who shoulder the burden of neutralizing the interpersonal effects of institutionalized heterosexual aesthetic labor. In other words, they are each individually responsible for dealing with daily negative outcomes of the salons\u0026rsquo; larger sexual cultures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe salons\u0026rsquo; clients pick-up on and exercise their \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; to the women\u0026rsquo;s bodies and sexualities. Their ogling and flirting creates dilemmas for these workers who then engage professionalizing and essentializing rhetoric to manage this objectification. These dilemmas were often justified with a casual \u0026ldquo;boys will be boys\u0026rdquo; attitude that allows interactions with clients to continue uninterrupted.

Our research shows that these attitudes do matter \u0026mdash; over and above factors that others have widely noted, such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/01/how-your-parenting-style-predicts-whether-you-support-donald-trump/\"\u003eauthoritarianism\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clinton-wasnt-wrong-about-the-deplorables-among-trumps-supporters/2016/09/12/93720264-7932-11e6-beac-57a4a412e93a_story.html?utm_term=.1e824810b6e2\"\u003eethnocentrism\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and anxiety about \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/12/a-massive-new-study-debunks-a-widespread-theory-for-donald-trumps-success/\"\u003eeconomic stagnation\u003c/a\u003e. Moreover, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/us/politics/donald-trump-supporters.html?_r=0\"\u003eanger\u003c/a\u003e so visible in this emotionally charged campaign may be helping to make sexism more of a political force.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe impact of sexism on Trump support predates the famous tape\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIn June 2016, we conducted a nationally representative survey of 700 U.S. citizens. They were asked whether they agreed with statements such as \u0026ldquo;Most women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Many women are actually seeking special favors, such as hiring policies that favor them over men, under the guise of asking for equality.\u0026rdquo; An index based on these statements is widely used in social science research on sexism and gender attitudes.\r\n\r\nWe found that sexism was strongly and significantly correlated with support for Trump, even after accounting for party identification, ideology, authoritarianism and ethnocentrism. In fact, the impact of sexism was equivalent to the impact of ethnocentrism and much larger than the impact of authoritarianism. Again, this was in June \u0026mdash; well before the \u0026ldquo;Access Hollywood\u0026rdquo; tape was released and several women came forward to accuse Trump of unwanted touching or kissing.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow anger \u0026mdash; not fear \u0026mdash; makes sexism more important\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe election has also been one of the most emotionally charged in recent memory. A significant amount of conventional wisdom suggests that fear is a special catalyst of support for Trump. Interestingly, however, recent research suggests that fear will often \u003cstrong\u003edampen\u003c/strong\u003e rather than boost the impact of attitudes like sexism, ethnocentrism and authoritarianism.\r\n\r\nAnger, on the other hand, may have very different political consequences. It emerges when out-groups are seen as violating long-held norms and disrupting preexisting social hierarchies. For this reason, it tends to make attitudes like sexism or ethnocentrism more important. Anger also has other important consequences distinct from fear: It can powerfully \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231894452_Election_Night's_Alright_for_Fighting_The_Role_of_Emotions_in_Political_Participation\"\u003emobilize\u003c/a\u003e voters and lead them to take \u003ca href=\"http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=94689291-43cc-4103-ab02-9afa4281de4a%40sessionmgr4007\u0026amp;vid=0\u0026amp;hid=4107\u0026amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=2001-07168-011\u0026amp;db=pdh\"\u003egreater risks\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and reject attempts to \u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12164/abstract\"\u003ecorrect their misperceptions\u003c/a\u003e or process new information.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what our research shows regarding sexism and support for Trump. In a February 2016 experiment, we first asked random subsets of respondents to think of a time in their life when they were either scared, angry or relaxed. This is called an emotion induction manipulation, and it causes respondents to feel these emotions keenly.\r\n\r\nAfter priming these emotions, we asked individuals how much they supported Donald Trump. Among respondents who were primed to feel afraid, the impact of sexism on support for Trump was smaller, compared with\u0026nbsp;respondents primed to feel angry or relaxed. In contrast, among respondents primed to feel angry, the impact of sexism was slightly larger than those primed to feel relaxed.\r\n\r\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2016/10/Graph-21.png\" alt=\"Graph 2(1)\" width=\"737\" height=\"536\"\u003e\r\n\r\nMany political observers have assumed that fear \u0026mdash; of changing demographics and declining economic conditions \u0026mdash; are motivating support for Trump, especially among those with less favorable views of certain groups. But our research suggests that the role of racial prejudice or sexism may be catalyzed more by anger.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eIs this unique to Trump?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTrump is not the only candidate whose support is linked to attitudes about women. In our June survey, we found that respondents scoring higher in sexism were, unsurprisingly, significantly less supportive of Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nMoreover, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-gender/article/the-growing-influence-of-gender-attitudes-on-public-support-for-hillary-clinton-20082012/883A6387D1D3C581E71D7676A9FD630B\"\u003eother research\u003c/a\u003e has shown that sexism is associated with support for many political figures in both parties \u0026mdash; including, in 2012, Barack Obama (negatively) and Mitt Romney (positively). Although partisanship \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/06/27/gender-stereotypes-have-become-less-powerful-in-u-s-elections-heres-why/\"\u003eoften matters more\u003c/a\u003e than attitudes about gender in determining preferences in general election matchups between Democratic and Republican candidates, our and others\u0026rsquo; research suggests that sexism may be baked into how Americans view the political parties.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, a dominant narrative in this election \u0026mdash; about \u0026ldquo;fearful authoritarians\u0026rdquo; who are resentful of immigrants and other minorities \u0026mdash; misses out on a crucial dynamic of this campaign. And in a campaign that promises to feature even more angry rhetoric in its closing weeks, it seems likely that sexism will continue to affect how Americans see both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003eCarly Wayne is a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of Michigan.

It will demonstrate that whilst regions, places and people are influenced by global processes and paradigms, these move and embed in different ways across spaces, time and scales. In this context, the article seeks to develop a more nuanced appreciation of ‘the social lives’ of global policy models, engaging with the role of ideas and institutions and the interactions of transnational, national and local dynamics in the shaping of gender equality policies and everyday experiences. Drawing on qualitative data collected in Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei the article draws out the perceptions of individuals from different policy, sectoral, social and cultural settings of gender equality. It highlights the tensions and disjunctures between general principles and particular situations, and in embedding gender equality policies into the social imaginaries and everyday lives of women and men. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the role of place and power relations in shaping localized responses to and experiences of gender justice.\n\n#香港研究 #香港研究學院 #學術期刊 #比較研究 #性別平等 #性別平等主流化\n\n-----------------------------------\nFollow me：\n1.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"102705834"},"body":"Does viewing #porn diminish #religiosity over time? A new study with a sample of about 2,000 people finds that the answer is yes--and no. For both men and women, viewing porn more often in 2006 was linked to increases in religious #doubt and decreases in religious salience in 2012. However, the effect of earlier #pornography use on later later religious service attendance and #prayer was curvilinear, meaning that service attendance and prayer declined at a point but then INCREASED at higher levels of porn use. These findings suggest that viewing pornography may lead to declines in *some* dimensions of religiosity but at more extreme levels may actually stimulate, or at least be conducive to, greater religiosity along other dimensions.\n#legitsexscience #sexscience #sexresearch #sexsciencenews #khanscope\nLink to study: ow.ly/4mPR2E","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"6524203"}]}

The demands of service can cause relationships to come under strain placing huge demands upon both spouses and their children. Children of military personnel often have their education disrupted by frequent moves. Health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which affect military servicemen and women, can have knock-on negative consequences for the rest of the family. Ex-service personnel who are divorced or separated are considerably more likely to report mental illness, relationship or isolation difficulties and physical health problems than those who are not.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"103643255"},"body":"A new study with a sample of 500 undergrads finds that participating in sex or #trauma research is not any more emotionally distressing than participating in minimal-risk cognitive tasks or normal life stressors. In fact, most participants generally find participation in #sexresearch *less* distressing than normal life stressors and even enjoyable. These findings hold true even for research subjects over whom institutional review boards express concern, such as participants who are younger, ethnic minorities, or who have certain psychological or personality traits. What this study tells us, then, is that participating in “sensitive topics” research is not particularly emotionally distressing, even for people who are vulnerable.

In the name of protecting research participants, IRBs often given studies focusing on \u0026ldquo;sensitive topics\u0026rdquo; heightened scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSex is often considered to be a sensitive topic, and many researchers (myself included) have encountered difficulties at one time or another in getting certain studies approved because their IRBs are concerned that students might be traumatized by certain kinds of sex questions (e.g., how would students who have been sexually victimized feel if they were asked questions about prior experiences with rape and sexual assault?).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortunately, research suggests that college students are more resilient than IRBs have given them credit for. As some evidence of this, a 2012 study published in \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2012/7/4/good-news-for-sex-researchers-sex-surveys-pose-no-harm-to-st.html\"\u003ePsychological Science\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e found that students who completed sex surveys did not experience elevated levels of psychological distress afterward compared to students who completed other cognitive tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, students actually reported feeling less distressed after completing a sex survey than they did beforehand. Furthermore, they rated this experience as less stressful than a number of ordinary stressors they encounter every day, such as spilling your coffee, having to wait in line, and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps most important of all, though, these results held even among persons who reported having been victims of sexual violence\u0026mdash;completing a sex survey that included questions about prior victimization experiences didn\u0026rsquo;t make them feel any worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe same team of researchers that conducted this study recently reanalyzed their data to look at whether their findings were consistent across other groups of people. For instance, do reactions to sex surveys depend upon someone\u0026rsquo;s sex, race, level of religiosity, personality, or baseline level of psychological distress?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe results, recently reported in the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27093242\"\u003eJournal of Sex Research\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, suggest that they don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, demographic variables (age, race, sex) were unrelated to how participants felt about the sex survey. The only difference they found was that participants of Hispanic ethnicity reported feeling even more positively about the sex survey than White participants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonality and psychological variables were largely unrelated to how people felt about the sex survey, too. A few statistically significant associations emerged, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, participants high in the personality trait of agreeableness reported more perceived benefits of taking part in the sex study, while those high in the personality trait of neuroticism reported more costs associated with their participation and more negative emotions afterward. However, even those who were very high in neuroticism (specifically, 2 standard deviations above the mean) were still reporting very low levels of costs and distress overall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, there were some statistically significant differences here, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t practically significant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn all, the results of this reanalysis combined with the results of the originally published study suggest that sex surveys pose little risk to college student participants and that sex studies don\u0026rsquo;t need to be held to an arbitrarily high level of scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, I should note that these results were based on a survey of students at just one university in the Southwestern United States. Thus, it would be worthwhile to attempt to replicate these results more broadly. For the time being, though, the available evidence suggests that sex isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently a \u0026ldquo;sensitive\u0026rdquo; research topic.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to learn more about \u003cem\u003eSex and Psychology \u003c/em\u003e?

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"122771845"},"body":"\u003cp\u003eGOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has bragged about laying his hands on women without their permission, and numerous women have come forward to claim that he assaulted them. In the past and throughout the campaign, he has used \u003ca href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a44629/donald-trump-insults-women/\"\u003eraw and disrespectful\u003c/a\u003e language to describe women, including his opponent, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. When confronted about this language in the second presidential debate, Trump trivialized it as \u0026ldquo;locker-room talk.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy 12-year-old son overheard the \u0026ldquo;locker-room\u0026rdquo; statement as I watched the debate. \u0026ldquo;What are they talking about?\u0026rdquo; he asked. My heart sank and my mind went blank. I mumbled something, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what. Then I rallied and said: \u0026ldquo;Donald Trump bragged about grabbing women without permission. He is not a good man.\u0026rdquo; To which my son said, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, he sucks.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have readily discussed Trump\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eracial\u003c/em\u003e comments with my son, in part because he told me that he heard peers \u003ca href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_talk_with_your_kids_about_donald_trump\"\u003etalking about them\u003c/a\u003e at school. Perhaps as a result, I get the distinct impression that my kids have come to think of Trump as a kind of American Voldemort. That\u0026rsquo;s fine with me. One \u003ca href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/building_inclusive_school_community_during_divisive_election\"\u003esurvey of educators\u003c/a\u003e, published in April, found that Trump\u0026rsquo;s racial rhetoric triggered\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;fear\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;anxiety\u0026rdquo; in minority students. Worse, educators reported a rise in bullying against these students, sometimes using words heard in the campaign. I don\u0026rsquo;t want my boys to think that\u0026rsquo;s OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t want them to think that about Trump\u0026rsquo;s sexual comments, either. And yet I\u0026rsquo;ve been extremely reluctant to discuss them with my son and stepson. Why? My middle-school boys are entering adolescence, so perhaps I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing fatherly jitters in confronting the fact that they are becoming sexual creatures. But the truth might be more complicated than that. Part of me fears that by drawing attention to Trump\u0026rsquo;s words I\u0026rsquo;ll be normalizing them. If I pretend Trump\u0026rsquo;s sexual attitudes don\u0026rsquo;t exist, then, an irrational part of me hopes, my boys will pretend with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not alone. When I surveyed Facebook friends, almost all of them shared my ambivalence. Most assumed that their boys hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard the genital-grabbing comments. As one mother said, \u0026ldquo;My kids (both boys) are much more aware of Trump\u0026rsquo;s racist comments than sexist ones. Maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t hear us as parents talking about the p****-grabbing body-shaming as much as about the wall, deporting Muslims, etc.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble with this perspective: How is it that our boys could be so aware of Trump\u0026rsquo;s demeaning comments about, for example, Mexicans, but not about women? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may have to do with the reluctance of children and parents to discuss sex with each other. If my own youth was any indication, most middle- and high-school boys would rather die than discuss sexual matters with their parents. Do you know what else I remember? A lot of very careless sexual talk with my friends, and all of us discovering pornography, often by the beds of our fathers. Who wants to discuss this stuff? It seems to me that we\u0026mdash;both boys and parents\u0026mdash;are participating in a conspiracy of silence, based mainly on embarrassment and shame. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if they\u0026rsquo;re not paying any attention to politics, most kids have smartphones by the time they finish middle school. That means they have access to whatever\u0026rsquo;s on the Internet, including pornography, and they likely encounter plenty of language that\u0026rsquo;s far worse than what the GOP candidate said. From this perspective, Trump is just a symptom. The challenge we face goes well beyond November 8, when Americans will pick either Trump or Clinton. The problem is cultural and psychological; we can\u0026rsquo;t defeat misogyny with one vote. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo what can parents and educators\u0026mdash;especially men\u0026mdash;do to stop the \u0026ldquo;Trump effect\u0026rdquo; on tween and teen boys, building a culture of sexual consent and open communication? It\u0026rsquo;s not enough, in my view, to simply say: Don\u0026rsquo;t do it, don\u0026rsquo;t denigrate women, don\u0026rsquo;t touch them without their permission. Our boys also need positive ideals to strive for\u0026mdash;or at least some image of a man they are trying to become. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some tips, submitted with a lot of humility, based on a combination of my personal experience and research. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Choose to speak with boys\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMen should serve as an example to boys. This is a platitude, and a staple of articles like this one. And yet, in daily life, this advice can become remarkably tricky to put into practice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of fathers and male teachers will never commit sexual assault and would never, explicitly or implicitly, endorse the kind of behavior Trump does. Some think that\u0026rsquo;s enough. The trouble is that our children are surrounded by bad examples\u0026mdash;and it is quite easy be silent in the face of words and actions like Trump\u0026rsquo;s. Many of us, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, just don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start when it comes time to speak up. We\u0026rsquo;re afraid of looking stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy opinion? It\u0026rsquo;s more important to take an awkward stand (and risk teen ridicule) than to seem to take no stand at all. Our tweens and teens \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e learn about sexuality and violence. Our task is to prepare them for those lessons, as best we can. If the choice is between silence and a conversation, then I believe we need to pick conversation, every single time. That\u0026rsquo;s part of what it means to be an example, so that our boys will be more likely to speak up themselves, if confronted with words or behavior like Trump\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my friend Chris\u0026mdash;a health educator at a San Francisco public school\u0026mdash;heard about the \u003cem\u003eAccess Hollywood\u003c/em\u003e video in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, he didn\u0026rsquo;t wait: \u0026ldquo;I knew my 14-year-old son would probably see them skewering it the next night on \u003cem\u003eSaturday Night Live\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rdquo; So Chris texted him an article denouncing Trump\u0026rsquo;s comments, and added: \u0026ldquo;Remember that grabbing others\u0026mdash;especially their breasts, butts or genitals\u0026mdash;w/o consent is NEVER OK, and if you see someone doing that you should try to intervene.\u0026rdquo; Later, they talked about it in person, and then watched this clip from the \u003cem\u003eDaily Show\u003c/em\u003e together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis to me seems like a model response. Chris a) assumed his son would see it; b) immediately and unambiguously denounced the words and behavior; c) followed up the text with an in-person conversation; and d) engaged other media in the conversation, holding up positive examples alongside the negative one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if you hate Trump\u0026rsquo;s comments about women\u0026mdash;but are voting for him anyway? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think the first step is to admit that you face a real difficulty. It\u0026rsquo;s not that hard for me to imagine; I\u0026rsquo;ve voted for flawed candidates myself, because I supported their policies or felt that the other candidate was worse. It\u0026rsquo;s not my mission with this article to get anyone to change his vote. Here, I only ask this of us as men: Let\u0026rsquo;s not minimize the harm of words or behavior like Trump\u0026rsquo;s, when talking with our sons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Speak with boys about pornography and consent\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s comments about women are shocking because they seem pornographic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is \u003ca href=\"http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/05/27/jech-2015-205453\"\u003eno direct evidence\u003c/a\u003e that pornography fuels sexual violence\u0026mdash;but sexual violence is pervasive in pornography, and it is routinely depicted in other corners of popular culture. Studies estimate that anywhere from one to two thirds of porn videos include aggressive physical acts, like spanking, choking, binding, gagging\u0026mdash;or, yes, suddenly grabbing another person\u0026rsquo;s genitals, as Trump said he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are images our boys will see, don\u0026rsquo;t doubt it for a second. Most research suggests that boys are first exposed to porn at age 11 or 12\u0026mdash;which, as the father of two 12-year-old boys, I completely believe. Most of their peers have smartphones and unfettered access to the Internet. As they reach adolescence, they\u0026rsquo;re going to stumble across a lot of things they can\u0026rsquo;t un-see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of which: What do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e do in the bedroom? Many parents like to tie each other up, or so I\u0026rsquo;m told. Some might even break out the floggers and riding crops when they have a rare Saturday night to themselves. But there is a huge difference between what happens in real life and what happens in porn. There\u0026rsquo;s a critical element in the sex lives of kinky adults that is missing from most videos: The negotiation, trust, and consent that must accompany this kind of real-world sexual play. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne \u003ca href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2016.1168353\"\u003enew study\u003c/a\u003e found that people who participate in BDSM (Bondage/Domination/Sado-Masochism) communities show \u0026ldquo;significantly lower levels of benevolent sexism, rape myth acceptance, and victim blaming\u0026rdquo; than did undergraduates or a group of random adults. This may seem paradoxical to some. BDSM scenes can appear, from the outside, to be forms of sexual assault, exploitation, or humiliation\u0026mdash;and in pornography, all you see is what\u0026rsquo;s outside. What some might not understand, however, is that such scenes are (ideally) meticulously negotiated beforehand, and only unfold in conditions of trust among all parties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s what boys need to hear about pornography. To be specific, as strange as this may sound: I think our teen boys need to hear what the BDSM community has to say\u0026mdash;because otherwise they may only hear what porn has to say. In other words, they need to hear that sex is about consent and communication\u0026mdash;it\u0026rsquo;s about what\u0026rsquo;s happening inside of us, not just about our appearances. If we\u0026rsquo;re not paying attention to feelings, our own and others\u0026rsquo;, we turn into Donald Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Encourage sexual self-awareness and intentionality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSexual communication often follows a script that is shaped by culturally defined roles for men and women. Men pursue, women draw them in. Sexually successful men are studs, but women are sluts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are biological forces that reduce our resistance to this script. Male or female, almost all of us know what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be in the grip of lust; especially when we\u0026rsquo;re young, that powerful shot of \u003ca href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_love_grows_in_your_body\"\u003etestosterone and dopamine\u003c/a\u003e can override our judgment and our ethics. In the heat of the moment, it just feels right to mindlessly obey unconscious impulses and stereotypes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s why our sons (and daughters) need to hear this message: Stop sleepwalking, and wake up. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRespecting women isn\u0026rsquo;t about suppressing sexual desires and impulses; it\u0026rsquo;s about non-judgmentally cultivating awareness of them. If we know what\u0026rsquo;s driving us, we can take control of ourselves and we can consciously set new intentions. If your subconscious drive is to just get laid and you\u0026rsquo;re not aware of that, you may find yourself doing things that are emotionally destructive, or even criminal. If, on the other hand, you set the intention to connect with another human being, to get to know them, to make them happy, to give them pleasure\u0026mdash;then you increase the likelihood that those things will happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think, for most tween and teen boys, this is the place to start\u0026mdash;to talk about our own intentions when it comes to sexual relationships, and to ask them to explore their own. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m talking about \u003ca href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition#what_is\"\u003emindfulness\u003c/a\u003e, of course, or the beginnings of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo some, mindfulness has become a clich\u0026eacute;, and yet every day, people destroy their own lives through the lack of it. I look at a man like Donald Trump and I see a man who is not self-aware. He acts, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t reflect. He speaks, without thinking about the impact of his words. In the \u003cem\u003eAccess Hollywood\u003c/em\u003e audio, he\u0026rsquo;s filled with lust, but it\u0026rsquo;s mechanical, foolish, dull. That\u0026rsquo;s not an example I want my boys to follow. Instead I want to ask them to be curious, creative, and caring. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I do that? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, to be honest. As I try to help them grow, I have my own work to do. All I can do right now is try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Speak out for an alternative sexual paradigm\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn my view, the debate about Trump\u0026rsquo;s sexual comments really pits two different paradigms against each other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne paradigm insists men can say what they want to women and put their hands on women whenever the \u0026ldquo;uncontrollable urge\u0026rdquo; strikes; the way for women to control men\u0026rsquo;s wild urges is by concealing their bodies. The boundary between \u0026ldquo;male\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;female\u0026rdquo; is rigidly demarcated and policed; everything depends on that, because otherwise how can you allocate the power? If the man denies doing \u0026ldquo;what every man does,\u0026rdquo; as Trump has, then of course he is believed, and his female accusers are denigrated as unattractive liars, or (if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work) so sexy that the men just couldn\u0026rsquo;t control themselves. This attitude often goes hand-in-hand with the elevation of certain female body types, combined with disgust for women\u0026rsquo;s bodies generally. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut there is another way of talking about sexuality. In this alternate paradigm, people of both sexes and all genders are asked to take responsibility for themselves and their desires. Men are not slaves to primal urges; women need to say what they want. \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; means yes and \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; means no. People do what they want with their own bodies and they control what happens to them. In this paradigm, you don\u0026rsquo;t shift blame from the more-powerful to the less-powerful. You don\u0026rsquo;t assume men have more rights (and fewer responsibilities) than women. You don\u0026rsquo;t even necessarily divide humans into \u0026ldquo;men\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;women\u0026rdquo;; you accept that people play with masculine and feminine traits, and can be whatever they want to be. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s my vision of a positive, healthy sexuality, but there are no utopias here. Just people doing their best. When we sit down to talk with our boys about women and sexuality, that\u0026rsquo;s what we need to bring to the table: our best.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreaterGoodFeatures/~4/2dk_EXbnfSc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"\u003e","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"4069788"},{"$numberLong":"7064295"}]}

However, many folks agree to some form of \u003cem\u003econsensual non-monogamy\u003c/em\u003e (CNM) in which they permit each other to have multiple sexual and/or romantic relationships at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA new study published in the \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2016.1178208\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJournal of Sex Research\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e suggests that Americans are increasingly interested in learning about CNM. The author of this study, Dr. Amy Moors of the University of Michigan, determined this by analyzing Google search trends in the United States between the years 2006-2015.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, Moors looked at search trends for three types of CNM: polyamory, swinging, and open relationships. What she found was that searches for polyamory and open relationships significantly increased across the decade (see data below), whereas searches for swinging decreased.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoors compared these trends to those of other popular keywords in order to determine whether these were unique patterns. In other words, were people just searching for more of everything over time, or were they specifically searching more for information on polyamory and open relationships? The results supported the idea that this was indeed a unique pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese findings suggest that Americans are increasingly interested in learning about certain departures from monogamy\u0026mdash;specifically, polyamory and open relationships. Whether this means people want to practice them (versus just learn about them) is a different question that these data cannot answer, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, we can\u0026rsquo;t say based on these data who exactly has become more interested in CNM. Is it limited to certain subsets of the population, or is the interest broad-based? We need more research to know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEither way, it's clear that interest in learning about relationship diversity and variations on monogamy is on the rise in the United States.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to learn more about \u003cem\u003eSex and Psychology \u003c/em\u003e?

A second reason is largely cultural, rather than economic: although the majority of young men today espouse egalitarian ideals, many of them are likely to avoid using these policies if they share the traditionally gendered cultural belief that women, not men, should take responsibility for a larger share of housework and childcare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the story doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there. Scholars have also found that men\u0026rsquo;s preferences and behaviors are often driven by the degree to which they feel a sense of social approval from other men. This suggests that some men may not utilize or may not support work-family policies simply because they sense that other men would judge them negatively if they were to take advantage of these policies. Insofar as men believe that their male peers value paid work as a distinctively masculine responsibility, taking on a nontrivial amount of responsibility for housework and childcare may raise concerns about how they would be perceived within their social circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeasuring Men\u0026rsquo;s Responsiveness to Work-Family Policies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe designed a study that addresses these issues by identifying and measuring the extent to which young men\u0026rsquo;s cultural beliefs about gender conditions their responses to supportive work-family policies. Specifically, we conducted a survey experiment to investigate whether there is a direct, causal effect of having access to supportive work-family policies on young men\u0026rsquo;s preferences for progressive relationships, and whether the strength of this relationship is dependent upon on a man\u0026rsquo;s cultural beliefs about gender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this in mind, we focused our study on two types of beliefs: 1) gender ideology and 2) masculinity norms. The first was measured by whether respondents believe that other men \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e have gender-egalitarian relationships. The second was captured by whether respondents believe that other men \u003cem\u003eactually do\u003c/em\u003e aspire to have gender-egalitarian relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe conducted our survey with a nationally representative sample of unmarried, childless, American men between the ages of 18 and 32. We asked each respondent to express how he would ideally prefer to divide work and domestic responsibilities with his future partner. However, we randomly assigned participants to one of two groups. The first set of participants was told to state how they would ideally organize their future work and family responsibilities under the assumption that supportive work-family policies were in place. Specifically, they were told to imagine that they had access to paid family leave, subsidized childcare, and flexible workplace practices. For the second set of participants, we again asked the men about how they would ideally like to balance work and family life in the future. However, we did not mention anything about supportive work-family policies. We then asked all participants a series of questions about how they believe most men should organize work and family obligations, and how most men their age actually do prefer to organize these obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Did We Find?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is one key finding from our research, it is this: men\u0026rsquo;s responses to the supportive work-family policy prime are contingent on their personal beliefs about what the majority of other young men want. For men who believe that the majority of their male peers in fact want to take on equal or primary responsibility for housework and/or childcare, supportive work-family policies are associated with nearly 26 percent higher odds of stating a preference for a progressive relationship (that is, being in an egalitarian relationship or being in a relationship where they would be primarily responsible for housework and childcare).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy contrast, we find that men\u0026rsquo;s responses to the supportive work-family policy prime are not contingent on their gender ideologies: their value-laden beliefs about whether men ought to share equally in earning and caregiving. Whereas gender ideology affects many things, our findings suggest that deep changes to men\u0026rsquo;s ideological beliefs are not a prerequisite for increasing men\u0026rsquo;s responsiveness to supportive work-family policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does This Leave Us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few key insights emerge from this research with regards to work and family life, masculinity, and the determinants of men\u0026rsquo;s responses to supportive work-family policies. Previous research has shown that men\u0026rsquo;s overall resistance to interventions aimed at supporting dual-earner, dual-caregiver relationships has proven to be a stumbling block to attaining greater gender equality. Our findings add nuance to existing work by demonstrating that men\u0026rsquo;s resistance is far from ubiquitous and is in fact contingent on a man\u0026rsquo;s perceptions of how their male peers are acting. Our findings, therefore, identify a key factor that contributes to persistent patterns of gender inequality in the workplace and at home and, in turn, offer insights that are useful to generating solutions. By designing work-family policies that consider and account for masculinity norms, we may be able to dismantle a key source of persistent gender inequalities in modern society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article is based on the paper, \u0026lsquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gas.sagepub.com/content/30/4/590.abstract\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMasculinity and the Stalled Revolution\u0026rsquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, in Gender \u0026amp; Society.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFeatured \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/_-o-_/8027725497/\"\u003eimage \u003c/a\u003ecredit: \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/_-o-_/\"\u003eThomas \u003c/a\u003e(Flickr, \u003ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\"\u003eCC-BY-2.0\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/comments-policy/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease read our comments policy before commenting\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote:\u0026nbsp; This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USAPP \u0026ndash; American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShortened URL for this post:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2dNjDJp\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/2dNjDJp\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e_______________________________\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"Author\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the authors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/files/2016/10/Sarah-Thebaud-80x108.jpg\" alt=\"sarah-thebaud-80x108\" width=\"80\" height=\"108\"\u003eSarah Th\u0026eacute;baud \u0026ndash; \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eUniversity of California, Santa Barbara\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSarah Th\u0026eacute;baud is assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a faculty research associate of the Broom Center for Demography.

Understanding condom use motives is critical to increasing condom use. Research in this area is limited, particularly regarding the roles of partners and relationship factors. Using a longitudinal sample of 441 young adults and 684 reported partnerships we examined associations between relationship factors and condom use motives (pregnancy prevention, disease prevention, or dual protection). Simultaneous multilevel models identified variables associated with motives; level-specific models identified the levels (individual, partnership, time) variables impacted motives. Participants reported choosing condoms for pregnancy prevention, disease prevention, and dual protection in 51%, 17%, and 33% of partnerships, respectively. Partner-specific factors varied, to a differing degree, across the three levels. Seven variables (duration, condom self-efficacy, commitment, sexual decision-making, power, and vulnerability to harm [HIV/STIs] and pregnancy) distinguished condom use motives. The level of this association varied but was most pronounced at the partner and individual levels. Researchers and practitioners should consider the impact of both individual- and partner-level factors on condom use motives, in both research and sexual health programs.﻿ Competing Priorities: Partner-Specific Relationship Characteristics and Motives for Condom Use Among At-Risk Young Adults (2016).

It also says that sexting has become \u003ca href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/reframing-sexting.pdf\"\u003eextremely common\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Sending someone a sext message is not much different than writing an 1800\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp;erotic love note,\u0026rdquo; says Joe Currin, research coordinator for the \u003ca href=\"https://education.okstate.edu/sexualhealth\"\u003eSexual Health Research Lab\u003c/a\u003e at Oklahoma State\u0026nbsp;University. \u0026ldquo;Behaviors are adapting to the use of newer technologies. We just now have the ability to express our sexuality in real time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo what factors make the difference between good sexting and bad sexting? Here\u0026rsquo;s a list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Enthusiastic consent\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis should go without saying, but common sense plus research says that sexting needs to be mutual, enthusiastic, and consensual. Sexting gets a bad name partially because too many people receive unsolicited and unwanted nude pictures. Properly speaking, this is sexual harassment, not sexting, and it can be scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can also be compelled to sext against their will, which may be linked to other kinds of abuse. A \u003ca href=\"http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/20/0886260516660300.full\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e published last month in the \u003cem\u003eJournal of Interpersonal Violence\u003c/em\u003e found that 21 percent of the 885 undergraduates surveyed\u0026mdash;most of them women\u0026mdash;had been coerced at some point into providing sexual messages. The study also linked coerced sexting to \u0026ldquo;mental health symptoms, sexual problems, and attachment dysfunction,\u0026rdquo; which leads the researchers to describe it as a form of intimate partner abuse. In fact, this and \u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215002836\"\u003eseveral studies\u003c/a\u003e published last year suggest that coerced sexting may be a danger sign that the relationship could involve physical coercion or even violence.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis leads to the next condition for successful sexting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Emotional safety, respect, and communication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSexting is not the same as sex, in the sense that bodies are not directly interacting. It is, rather, minds interacting through phones. Just as sex flourishes in conditions of physical safety and respect, so sexting requires a certain degree of emotional safety if it is to work for both parties. When that condition is absent, sexting hurts the relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis may sound simple, but the research reveals some tricky nuances. A \u003ca href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2016.1181147?scroll=top\u0026amp;needAccess=true\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e published earlier this year found that people who feared looking bad in the eyes of their partners were more likely to engage in sexting, suggesting that while the sexts weren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily coerced, they were being exchanged only to please a partner, not themselves. It suggests, further, that they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel confident enough in the relationship to simply say \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; to unwanted sexual activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCurrin\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01926187.2016.1145086?needAccess=true\"\u003eresearch with colleagues\u003c/a\u003e actually finds that heterosexual women feel a lot of anxiety when they don\u0026rsquo;t want to reply to a sext\u0026mdash;but lesbians and men do not. Why? It may have a lot to do with the degree to which a woman wants to conform to a traditionally feminine ideal\u0026mdash;what Currin calls a \u0026ldquo;controlling image\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;which pits pressure to comply against seeing sexts as simply lewd. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;For non-heterosexual individuals, they\u0026rsquo;re already going against what society says they should be doing\u0026mdash;so doing this other behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother me if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother the other person,\u0026rdquo; says Currin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis line of research suggests sexting needs to occur within the wider context of honest, back-and-forth conversation. How does your partner really feel about sexting? What kinds of sexts are acceptable and what are not? In what circumstances, if any, could pictures or text be shared? Is there a type of communication that feels threatening or just uncomfortable? While it may seem not-fun to have such conversations, their absence can destroy a relationship. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is especially the case when a partner has past bad experiences\u0026mdash;or an insecure attachment style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Pay attention to attachment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most interesting dimension of sexting research involves \u003ca href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_stop_attachment_insecurity_from_ruining_your_love_life\"\u003eattachment theory\u003c/a\u003e, which refers to how childhood relationships with our parents can shape our adult ones. People who grow up to have a secure attachment style find intimacy easy; those with anxious or even avoidant styles might struggle with closeness and cooperation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSexting can help a couple become more attuned to each other, says Rob Weisskirch, a researcher at California State University, Monterey Bay. But \u003ca href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cyber.2015.0334\"\u003emany studies\u003c/a\u003e find that it can also hint at anxiety. According to \u003ca href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2016.1181147?scroll=top\u0026amp;needAccess=true\"\u003ethis research\u003c/a\u003e, insecurely attached people are \u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211000550\"\u003emore likely\u003c/a\u003e to engage in sexting\u0026mdash;and this, for them, is actually associated with greater relationship satisfaction. Why, and what this means, is still a matter of debate among researchers and therapists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that sexting is unhealthy, says Indiana University psychologist Michelle Drouin. \u0026ldquo;Instead, it is more likely that those who want to keep a bit more distance in their relationship (and women who want to keep partners closer) use sexting to fill sexual needs. For these individuals, sexting may actually help them by increasing their sexual or relationship satisfaction.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom line is that in this dimension of a relationship, as in others, it pays to know your attachment style\u0026mdash;and that of your partner. \u0026ldquo;Recognize the attachment pattern and look for ways of providing the feedback needed,\u0026rdquo; suggests Weisskirch.\u0026nbsp;(Incidentally, \u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216302333\"\u003eone Hungarian study\u003c/a\u003e published last year found that attachment style can even extend to our relationship with our phones.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. (Creative) honesty\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike other items on this list, honesty falls into the category of obvious-but-tricky. Several studies suggest that \u003ca href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0576-3\"\u003edeception-while-sexting\u003c/a\u003e is commonplace\u0026mdash;and this is especially true for women who try to avoid emotional connection and intimacy, often as a result of childhood experiences. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214001150\"\u003e2014 study\u003c/a\u003e by Michelle Drouin and colleagues found that almost half of the people in their sample of 155 heterosexual college students had sent deceptive sexts. These were often benign or even playful lies about what they were wearing or their state of arousal that were intended to entertain or titillate their partners. Women lied far more often than men, but mainly if they were anxiously attached\u0026mdash;implying that they worried their significant other might go away if he didn\u0026rsquo;t get what he wanted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Lying during sexting, just like pretending orgasm in a face-to-face context, is more likely to occur among those with insecure attachments to relationship partners,\u0026rdquo; write the authors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, should you never lie when sexting? Instead of making up sexy details or responses, is it better just to say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m bored\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m grocery shopping\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m wearing that pair of underwear that sags around my butt\u0026rdquo;? To Drouin, it really depends. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In a follow-up paper I\u0026rsquo;ve done, but not yet published, I found that many people consider sexting just fantasy,\u0026rdquo; says Drouin. \u0026ldquo;They use sexting to spice things up, and few are honest about what they are doing, wearing, or intending to do with a partner. Additionally, most people know and expect that others aren\u0026rsquo;t being honest during sexting.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo is it better build up a fantasy or keep it real? \u0026ldquo;Depends on your personal boundaries, both sexually and in terms of how authentic you want your interaction to be,\u0026rdquo; says Drouin. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich gets us back to consent, safety, communication, and emotional security. \u0026ldquo;Sure, sexting might be used to spice up a sexual relationship, but if one partner or another doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like the communication is appropriate or authentic, it could also cause issues in the relationship,\u0026rdquo; says Drouin. At its best, sexting is playful and imaginative. If everyone is knowingly and voluntarily participating in the fantasy, it\u0026rsquo;s fun. If they\u0026rsquo;re not, it can hurt the relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Sext with caution would be my suggestion,\u0026rdquo; she adds. \u0026ldquo;Better yet\u0026mdash;have sex instead.

Melanoma predisposition is highest in people with many moles, fair skin, blue or green eyes, blond or red hair, and freckles, who never tan and always burn after UV exposure. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther risk prediction factors of melanoma are old age and male sex. Melanoma is more common in men than in women, who also show a lower risk of metastases and higher survival rates than men. Anatomic location of melanoma also tends to be different between sexes, being most commonly on the lower leg, hip and thigh in women, and on the back, abdomen and chest in men. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan lang=\"en-GB\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy is it worse for men? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are marked differences between men and women in the incidence and expression of many diseases. Sex has profound effects on the physiology and susceptibility to disease, as well as in the responses to medical treatment.

Males and females differ in the metabolism of and response to estrogens and androgens. Estrogens stimulate pigmentation via activation and expression of genes involved in melanin synthesis, while androgens have an inhibitory effect on melanocytes. A clear example is hyperpigmentation (dark spots, linea nigra, melasma) commonly seen during pregnancy when there is an increase in the levels of estrogen and progesterone (pregnancy-related hormones). Furthermore, estrogens also accelerate wound healing, improve in\u0026#64258;ammatory disorders, increase skin thickness and protect from skin photoaging. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehavioral and socio-cultural reasons are other proposed explanations for sex differences observed in melanoma. Men, as compared with women, tend to spend more time outdoors, are less likely to use sunscreen, have a lower awareness of skin cancer risk, are less likely to self-detect their melanomas, and make fewer visits to the dermatologist. However, sex remains an independent prognostic indicator after adjustment for body-site distribution and survival indicators, suggesting that women\u0026rsquo;s sex advantage is independent of the differences in detection or in diagnostic delay between sexes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKeep calm, take care of your skin and enjoy outdoors!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther research is needed to better understand human pigmentation and melanoma, with the aim of improving targeted therapies and offering better preventative advice to patients.

{"_id":140396567,"body":"\u003cp\u003eMany straight-identified young women have same-gender sexual or romantic experiences. Research on sexual fluidity, hooking up, and \u0026ldquo;straight girls kissing\u0026rdquo; has largely focused on women living on the progressive campuses of selective universities. Yet women outside these elite spaces are more likely to report ever having had same-gender sex, despite being more likely to start families or settle down with men earlier in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePopular attention to the phenomenon reached a fever pitch when Katy Perry went platinum singing that she \u0026ldquo;kissed a girl\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;liked it.\u0026rdquo; More recently, Emmy-award winning stars at the heart of the popular shows \u003cem\u003eOrphan Black\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Good Wife\u003c/em\u003e have portrayed characters who have same-gender sex after establishing plotlines as presumably heterosexual women. As a twist to the first generation of primetime LGBTQ plots, these characters are not in their teens and/or confronting a sexual identity crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Straight girls kissing\u0026rdquo; has become something of a curious and controversial cultural touchstone. Some social scientists have used it as a launching point to study female bisexuality, but agree this attention has focused too narrowly on women living on the progressive campuses of selective universities, only bolstering stereotypes. How are young women\u0026rsquo;s experiences and understandings of same-gender sexuality shaped by their context?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ea stereotype-shattering demographic puzzle\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn 2011, the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) found that women with the \u003cem\u003elowest\u003c/em\u003e levels of educational attainment reported the \u003cem\u003ehighest\u003c/em\u003e lifetime prevalence of same-gender sex. \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e wrote that the study challenged \u0026ldquo;the popular stereotype of college as a hive of same-sex experimentation.\u0026rdquo; A 2016 update did not find a statistically significant pattern by education, but reiterated the high prevalence within this understudied demographic. As we will see, yesterday\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;LUG\u0026rdquo; (lesbian-until-graduation\u0026rdquo;) is today\u0026rsquo;s sexually experimental coed\u0026mdash;and both stereotypes divert attention from the women in the NSFG.\u003cspan\u003eIn 2011, the National Survey of Family Growth found that women with the \u003cem\u003elowest\u003c/em\u003e levels of educational attainment reported the \u003cem\u003ehighest\u003c/em\u003e lifetime prevalence of same-gender sex.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne reason this finding is puzzling is that it falls into a gap in how different types of social scientists typically study sexuality. Demographers tend to investigate gendered life experiences\u0026mdash;such as sex, relationships, pregnancy, and parenting\u0026mdash;excluding topics related to non-heterosexuality and often focusing on women between the ages of 18 to 24 (\u0026ldquo;the transition to adulthood\u0026rdquo;). This is a life stage when these life experiences begin to strongly diverge along race and class lines, with privileged women going to college, dating casually or hooking up instead of settling down, and delaying parenthood to advance their education and careers. Meanwhile, disadvantaged women are more likely to seek stability by commuting to school or studying part-time while balancing jobs and families. The women I interviewed who did pursue higher education did so in a very different space and context than women at elite universities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudies of sexuality based on in-depth interviews and ethnography tend to delve into identity and desire. For many college women, the \u0026ldquo;transition to adulthood\u0026rdquo; is a time of self-exploration and relative freedom to act on their sexual desires, including same-gender attractions (though many later settle into monogamous relationships with men). \u0026ldquo;Sexual fluidity\u0026rdquo; is an influential concept that explores how sexual desire could be context-specific or change over time. Recent sociology builds on this theory to explain how same-gender hookups are a \u0026ldquo;gender strategy\u0026rdquo; for college women in the Greek Life party scene as they paradoxically titillate men by making out while ostracizing lesbian and bisexual women. Scholarship has also explored how this hookup scene can serve as a low-stakes \u0026ldquo;opportunity structure\u0026rdquo; for queer women to explore authentic same-gender desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemographic surveys include the \u0026ldquo;straight girls kissing\u0026rdquo; who do \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e experience the \u0026ldquo;transition to adulthood\u0026rdquo; within elite university settings, but can\u0026rsquo;t explain the puzzles the numbers reveal. Our best sexuality theories are based on research that leaves these women out altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study followed 1,000 women for two-and-a-half years, collecting weekly surveys to learn about the prevalence, causes, and consequences of early, unintended pregnancy. Most demographic and fertility surveys do not explicitly collect data on sexual orientation or same-gender relationships (surveys about risk are an exception\u0026mdash;and this trend is changing), but valuable information about these topics is often there just below the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor three years, it was my job to handle RDSL participants\u0026rsquo; questions, comments, and complaints. Most inquiries were about how to complete the surveys or receive the incentive payment, but a few came from women unsure of whether the questions on sex and relationships were meant to include their girlfriends. In response to this feedback, I wrote new survey questions about sexual identity, behavior, and attraction. Over a \u003cem\u003ethird\u003c/em\u003e of RDSL participants (213 of the 579 who completed the new survey) gave some type of non-heterosexual response. I systematically recruited 35 of these women to interview. Participants were enrolled in RDSL at age 18-19 and interviewed at age 22-23. Because RDSL had a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample, representative of the Michigan county in which respondents lived, I was able to interview women that many sexualities scholars struggle to access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ehow early motherhood shapes sexual identity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemographers have written about how women of lower socioeconomic status have earlier paths toward family formation and are less comfortable hooking up. Sexualities researchers have written about how bisexual and other non-heterosexual women report declines in same-gender sex as they get older. These two patterns intersect earlier in the lives of my interviewees. The resulting, shorter timelines reflect socioeconomic status and limit possibilities for LGBTQ identification in two important ways: young moms put their identity as good and self-sacrificing parents first, and women in committed relationships with men simply felt their same-gender sexual desires or experiences were no longer relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flic.kr/p/7xmtV1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Women in the study described reconsidering sexual identities, relationships, and values after becoming mothers.\" height=\"511\" src=\"https://contexts.org/files/2017/03/FEA-Kissing-Image-1-Groceries-680x511.jpg\" width=\"680\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWomen in the study described reconsidering sexual identities, relationships, and values after becoming mothers.

Jayla, a Black woman with a recent bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree from a regional state school, became pregnant after her on-again/off-again boyfriend pressured her to stop using condoms. She described making big changes in her social circle after she and her infant daughter moved in with her parents. Previously, Jayla\u0026rsquo;s best friend had been a gay man, and she was the godmother of her lesbian friend\u0026rsquo;s daughter. \u0026ldquo;I think what our relationship didn\u0026rsquo;t survive was me becoming a mom. I even told him, \u0026lsquo;I will make you the godfather of my child,\u0026rsquo; but when reality hit\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m going to always do something for the sake of the child, this is where my opinion bursts forth. \u0026hellip;I kind of shifted myself away from them, because I know how I want to raise my daughter.\u0026rdquo; She severed these friendships, hoping to move on from the attraction she once felt for her lesbian friend and maybe even meet a man who would be a partner in parenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSimilarly, Summer, a Black woman with a high school degree, found herself reconsidering her progressive sexual values and the place of same-gender attraction in her life after becoming a mom in her late teens. Her four-year-old daughter asks questions about a cousin who has two moms. Summer calls herself \u0026ldquo;protective,\u0026rdquo; explaining, \u0026ldquo;I know my nephew got teased for having two moms. \u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t want [my daughter] to have to go through that.\u0026rdquo; Jayla and Summer are both confronting the challenges they see their gay friends and family struggle with as \u0026ldquo;out\u0026rdquo; individuals in their communities.\u003cspan\u003eIt can be easy to take for granted something young mothers get out of sexual friendships: friendship with a woman who shares their struggle and isolation.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, the mothers I interviewed saw their same-gender sexual experiences or desires as less relevant. It was more important, they felt, to focus on fulfilling expectations tied to being a \u0026ldquo;good mother\u0026rdquo;: self-sacrifice and \u0026ldquo;settling down\u0026rdquo;. If their child\u0026rsquo;s father was in the picture, this could mean bending over backward to make things work. None of these mothers saw raising their child with a woman as a real option, and they defended that idea by describing discrimination among family members, their sense of what was acceptable in their social circle, and the perception that same-sex families were simply not present in their communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ebisexual and monogamous?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActress Anna Paquin made national headlines in 2014 when she struggled to convince Larry King that actually, she \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e still be bisexual, even though she was married to a man. The late-night talk show host is not the only one confused by this idea. Those women among my interviewees who held proud bisexual identities or had girlfriends in high school struggled to find a place for this part of their sexuality alongside their commitment to their boyfriends or husbands. Some thought that having or planning a threesome could be a low-stakes way to bring up the issue of same-gender attraction within a relationship without challenging their primary identity as a mother or monogamous partner. In these cases, suggesting threesomes served as a way to offload attraction and longing, while ostensibly involving their partner in their sexuality without threatening the relationship. These interview participants brought up threesomes unprompted, and their stories challenge stereotypes about who wants threesomes and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarissa, a White mother working on an associate\u0026rsquo;s degree, was engaged to a man who disapproves of her past sexual experiences with women. Her tone was resigned and a bit sad as she described her situation: she still harbored strong romantic feelings for a married friend who never gave their former sexual friendship an official relationship status. Marissa said, \u0026ldquo;I wanted her to be my girlfriend, but she was married. It was like, \u0026lsquo;Well, if I can\u0026rsquo;t be your girlfriend, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do it anyway.\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;I told her I loved her one time. I was like, \u0026lsquo;I love you. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m in love with you.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Both women are now moms in relationships with men, but Marissa shared, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still kind of upset about it. I hang out with her every once in a while, and I get so jealous. I\u0026rsquo;m not a jealous person either. I just get so emotional when it comes to her.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContrary to stereotypes in which a threesome is every man\u0026rsquo;s fantasy, Marissa\u0026rsquo;s fianc\u0026eacute; was judgmental when she brought up the idea: \u0026ldquo;It makes him really insecure. He just doesn\u0026rsquo;t like it. When I told him about it, he said, \u0026lsquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;m ever going to be able to look at you the same.\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;m not a bad person. I\u0026rsquo;m not a whore or anything. \u0026hellip;Yeah, I was hurt.\u0026rdquo; The couple stayed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImani, a Black woman and part-time commuting student, lived with her parents while raising her four-year-old son. She is at a stalemate similar to Marissa\u0026rsquo;s: her boyfriend was excited about the idea of a threesome, but rejected Imani\u0026rsquo;s real-life plans to make it happen. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s told me before he wanted to do that. \u0026hellip; But [my high school girlfriend] would be the only person I\u0026rsquo;d do it with, and vice versa. So we\u0026rsquo;re at a stalemate.\u0026rdquo; Her ex\u0026rsquo;s boyfriend is enthusiastic about Imani joining \u003cem\u003ethem\u003c/em\u003e, but that\u0026rsquo;s not a motivating factor for Imani: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like him like that, it would be awkward for me. I would do it as a favor for \u003cem\u003eher\u003c/em\u003e maybe, but not for \u003cem\u003ehim\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rdquo; Both Marissa and Imani used threesomes as a way to bring up their same-gender attraction to their boyfriends, but by specifying their interest in a specific woman (with whom they\u0026rsquo;d previously been sexual), undermining what is stereotyped as every \u003cem\u003eman\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/em\u003e fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003esexual friendships\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe campuses, clubs, and classrooms of selective universities provide a specific context in which to understand women\u0026rsquo;s sexuality. Women on these campuses may have access to progressive ways of talking about same-gender sexuality, but the flipside is that they are \u003cem\u003eforced\u003c/em\u003e to confront pressures to name their experiences and label themselves. Outside of the university context, \u0026ldquo;sexual friendships\u0026rdquo; provide opportunities to explore same-gender sex and desire without labeling oneself with a sexual orientation that may be controversial or even unintelligible to friends and family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayla (introduced above) was chosen to be godmother to her best friend\u0026rsquo;s daughter, and their deep friendship is still intimate and playful: \u0026ldquo;The running joke between her fianc\u0026eacute; and I is she was married to \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e first.

The two women don\u0026rsquo;t discuss it directly, preferring to joke about moving to Canada to get married. Amy shares story after story of sexist disappointment involving bad boyfriends, disrespectful doctors, and offensive teachers. It\u0026rsquo;s all shifted her thinking about gender: \u0026ldquo;The more I see finding a soul mate in a man isn\u0026rsquo;t realistic, the more appealing [marrying my friend] is. \u0026hellip;I feel like a man will never understand me. I don\u0026rsquo;t think they \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e. Or, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that most men would \u003cem\u003ecare\u003c/em\u003e to.

But for my interviewees, \u0026ldquo;bisexual\u0026rdquo; was an untainted, easily understood idea. Nikki, a Black woman and part-time commuting student, said simply, \u0026ldquo;I always thought \u0026lsquo;bisexual\u0026rsquo; was a pretty good term for it.\u0026rdquo; Krystina, a White woman with a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree from a regional school, explained, \u0026ldquo;I feel like that\u0026rsquo;s much more acceptable in today\u0026rsquo;s society.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, they see \u0026ldquo;queer\u0026rdquo; as an alienating slur, not the empowering anti-label prevalent in university women\u0026rsquo;s studies classrooms. If \u0026ldquo;queer\u0026rdquo; is framed as a rejection of confining identity labels for more privileged women, Jayla and others in my study felt the term as \u0026ldquo;degrading.\u0026rdquo; Amber, a White woman with an associate\u0026rsquo;s degree, cautiously said, \u0026ldquo;I think, in a joking sense, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard people call each other that.

That is, we need to consider how different identities come together to make and shape each person and each social group. Sexuality is shaped by experiences and identities such as race, class, status as a parent, and specific environments (such as elite college campuses). In my study, I found that early motherhood limited possibilities for some women to develop or claim LGBTQ identities; they prioritized being self-sacrificing good mothers. My interviewees described specific experiences and observations that make these identities seemingly incompatible for them. I also found that sexual friendships gave some women a different way to explore same-gender sex and desire. Together, my findings show how sexual identification and acting on desire are intersectional processes and that the lives of \u0026ldquo;straight girls kissing\u0026rdquo; look different offstage and outside the college hookup scene. The feminist goal of intersectionality is often undermined by our focus on educated, middle-class White women in so much of our sexualities research. In this study, I used large-scale surveys as both a source of puzzles generating interesting research questions and a tool for recruiting participants. This allowed me to locate and learn from a more diverse group of women.

For instance, a 2016 study linked egalitarian heterosexual relationships, where the couples share gendered household chores, to greater sexual frequency. In another study, researchers found that the number of women who report ever having had sex with both men and women or just women (and identifying as bisexual or gay) has increased; however, the same study reported same-sex encounters have not increased for men. The researchers speculate that this could be a result of differing norms for men and women where it is more acceptable for women to deviate from heterosexual gender norms. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/object/paulaengland.html\"\u003ePaula England\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/object/soc.phd.emmamishel\"\u003eEmma Mishel\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://caudillomonica.com/\"\u003eM\u0026oacute;nica Caudillo\u003c/a\u003e. 2016. \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-3/november/SocSci_v3_951to970.pdf\"\u003eIncreases in Sex with Same-Sex Partners and Bisexual Identity Across Cohorts of Women (but Not Men)\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSociological Science\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan\u003e 3: 951\u0026ndash;70.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://faculty.utah.edu/u6007473-Daniel_L._Carlson/research/index.hml\"\u003eDaniel L.

For some white men, sex with other men does not threaten their heterosexuality, but rather bolsters their masculinity and serves to reaffirm their identities as straight men.

But for those who aren't so keen on politics, a myopic focus on policy and polls can be tiresome.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eWhat accounts for this variation across individuals, from the politically engrossed to the largely apathetic?\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eThere's quite a bit of \u003ca href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/brain-difference-democrats-republicans\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e on what determines an individual's party affiliation and political positions. But beyond particular views is the more basic question of political \u003cem\u003einterest\u003c/em\u003e. Here, too, research reveals some surprising and some not-so-surprising patterns in who cares about politics, at least in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eFirst, there's evidence that personality matters. One \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123408000173\"\u003eanalysis\u003c/a\u003e of three distinct data sets, each including hundreds of participants, found that people who were more open to experience (as reflected by traits like curiosity and intelligence) were more likely to show a high level of interest in politics, to report following politics, to be politically informed, and to engage in political discussions. Extraverts were likely to engage in political discussions, but not so likely to be politically informed. More surprisingly, people who were highly conscientious (e.g., organized, responsible) were neither particularly informed nor interested in politics, and those who were highly agreeable (e.g., warm, sympathetic) had a modest but consistent tendency to avoid political matters.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eSecond, there's \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532673X8901700106\"\u003eevidence\u003c/a\u003e that beliefs about government can have a significant influence on a person's political interest. People who believe that government is attentive to public opinion and responsive to the people are more likely to report high levels of interest in politics. This makes a lot of sense \u0026mdash; people are more interested when they think that their opinions matter.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eThird, there's \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2998592\"\u003eevidence\u003c/a\u003e that demographic factors are associated with political interest. On average, the very young and the very old show less political interest, and the more educated show greater political interest. Political interest is also spread unevenly across political affiliations \u0026mdash; data from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/section-10-political-participation-interest-and-knowledge/\"\u003ePEW Research Center\u003c/a\u003e, for example, suggests that \"solid liberals\" and \"steadfast conservatives\" are more interested in politics than those who hold more mixed views.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eAnother demographic characteristic that may be important is gender. An \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532673X8901700106\"\u003eanalysis\u003c/a\u003e of data from 1984 found that on average, American women reported less interest in politics than American men. This is potentially surprising in light of the fact that women voted at comparable rates to men during that period.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eOne relevant difference between men and women may be their sense for their own political competence: Women were less likely to believe that they could understand what happens in government and politics, and this belief was associated with lower levels of political interest. Consistent with this idea, an experimental \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X15000628\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e published earlier this year found that when women's perceived competence was increased, their political interest went up as well.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eAnother factor affecting women's relative disinterest is the under-representation of women in powerful political positions. A 1997 \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2998592\"\u003epaper\u003c/a\u003e reported mixed but suggestive evidence that the gap between men and women was driven by the perception that \"politics is a man's world\"; subsequent \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00124\"\u003eevidence\u003c/a\u003e supports the idea that with qualified female candidates running for office, women become more politically engaged.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eFinally, there's evidence that political events can influence political interest, but this influence is surprisingly small. An \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022381610000149\"\u003eanalysis\u003c/a\u003e of multiple datasets across several countries found that a person's level of political interest is relatively stable over time. The exception was in Germany in the period after reunification, suggesting that major political turmoil can lead to flux in general interest, but that by and large a person's level of interest is more affected by her personal characteristics than by the particular political events of the day. Those personal characteristics, in turn, are a mix of both \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1375/twin.15.1.15\"\u003egenetic\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/ap.2012.23\"\u003eenvironmental\u003c/a\u003e influences \u0026mdash; the very things that influence our personality, beliefs and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cdiv\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e   \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTania Lombrozo is a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

For each row copied correctly, they received 10 cents. At the end of the experiment, this was converted into real money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter each clerical task, students were presented with a tax scenario and were asked to report their income based on their earnings from the clerical task. There were three clerical tasks, and, after each clerical task, subjects were confronted with three unique tax scenarios. Therefore, there was a total of three clerical tasks and nine reporting rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp channel=\"wp.com\"\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    [\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/16/are-we-ready-to-raise-taxes-on-the-rich-history-says-no/?utm_term=.8ff7e552118b\"\u003eAre we ready to raise taxes on the rich?

In round one, participants paid taxes for no other reason than for the fact that we asked them to report their taxes. In rounds two and three, all of the tax revenue was put in a general fund and redistributed equally between participants, regardless of what they contributed.\u0026nbsp;In round three, we doubled the general fund. For rounds four through six, we adjusted the tax rates, so that in round four\u0026nbsp;it was 10 percent; in round five, 30\u0026nbsp;percent; and in round six, 50\u0026nbsp;percent. Finally, in rounds seven through nine, subjects were given two types of progressive taxation and a charity round in which we donated their tax revenue to a real-world charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents could report however much of their income they wanted. Although we didn\u0026rsquo;t state this explicitly, students, of course, understood that they\u0026rsquo;d keep more money if they didn\u0026rsquo;t report all their earnings, just as is true with actual taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a catch, however. We told them there was a 5 percent probability of being audited. If we caught them cheating, they would have to pay a fine equal to twice the taxes owed. Of course, with such a small chance of being audited and a rather small fine, from a rational choice perspective, the best choice would always be to report no income. (We\u0026rsquo;ve used this approach for other experiments, as you can see in a previous \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/04/15/the-word-tax-is-unpopular-but-the-word-fee-is-worse/?utm_term=.1d6b3db20f84\"\u003eMonkey Cage\u003c/a\u003e post).

We think so. We found similar results when we conducted a study with adults in the United Kingdom, which lends weight to the idea that\u0026nbsp;our study may be valid beyond this sample. In the adult sample, we had\u0026nbsp;90\u0026nbsp;individuals with an average age of 35, compared with an average age of 24\u0026nbsp;in our student population.

In addition to our tax compliance experiment, we conducted another experiment with the same students which examined levels of altruism. In this experiment, men and women in Sweden behaved quite similarly, meaning that both men and women were equally likely to give part, or all, of their money to a randomly assigned partner. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t true in Italy, the United States\u0026nbsp;and the United Kingdom. We believe that the very redistributionist nature of Swedish institutions encourages such altruism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp channel=\"wp.com\"\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    [\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/04/15/shadowy-hackers-have-just-dumped-a-treasure-trove-of-nsa-data-heres-what-it-means/?utm_term=.9917b3b69955\"\u003eHackers just dumped a trove of NSA data.

Many medical professionals now advocate for menstrual suppression, usually through hormonal treatments that many people are already using. Birth control options like the pill are being used as a way to improve the quality of life for those of us who get periods, but this medical development affects the social meaning of menstruation. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMenstruation is not simply a biological phenomenon. Rather, people experience menstruation within a social context. In a society that often assumes heterosexuality, girls\u0026rsquo; first periods mark them as sexual objects, indicating their ability to reproduce, and differentiating them from boys. After their first period, girls report feeling sexualized by others, as well as more ambivalent about their bodies. Menstruation often evokes disgust by both men and women, often becoming a social stigma that must be hidden. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/users/janet-lee\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJanet Lee\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e. 1994. \u0026ldquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gas.sagepub.com/content/8/3/343.short\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMenarche and the (Hetero)Sexualization of the Female Body\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGender \u0026amp; Society \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan\u003e8(3): 343-362.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.castleton.edu/directory/faculty-staff-directory/details/ingrid-johnston-robledo\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIngrid Johnston-Robledo \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003eand \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/joan-c-chrisler/\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJoan C.

In the light of new drugs specifically designed to suppress periods, the FDA and companies marketing the products make distinctions between bleeding that occurs while taking hormonal birth control and bleeding that occurs without it. They argue that \u0026ldquo;pill periods\u0026rdquo; are not in fact \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; periods because they are artificially modified and therefore unnecessary. This redefinition demonstrates how bodily processes, like menstruation, can be redefined and reimagined, and how the way they are experienced is influenced by social context.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.katiehasson.com/\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eKatie Ann Hasson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e. 2016. \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gas.sagepub.com/content/30/6/958\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026ldquo;Not a \u0026lsquo;Real\u0026rsquo; Period?

{"_id":128379777,"body":"Does sex decline with age?  Not necessarily.  A new study, published in the Journal of Sex Research in late 2016, disentangled the effect of age on sex.  The authors, Forbes, Eaton, \u0026 Krueger, aimed to understand the roles of other sexual domains (i.e., frequency, perceived control, thought and effort invested in sex, and number of sexual partners) by analyzing data from a large sample (n = 6,278) with a large age range (20-93), collected between 1995 and 2013. Results showed that age had a positive relationship with sexual quality of life.  These findings suggest that aging may be associated with the acquisition of skills and strategies that can buffer age-related declines in sexual quality of life, particularly in the context of a positive relationship. The authors of the study summarize these findings as sexual wisdom.","cites_papers":[13260383]}

Studies have shown, however, that a positive attitude towards school work and the support and encouragement from their parents can help at-risk youngsters to overcome the economic barriers and lack of resources they face. Most of the evidence about the effects of parental involvement comes from research on mothers. Little is known, however, about how adolescents experience their fathers’ warmth and the beliefs and behaviors that are most affected by it.\n\nThis new study is part of a larger one focusing on low-income, ethnic minority families conducted in four middle schools in the southwestern United States. Data were analyzed from questionnaires completed by 183 sixth-graders about how optimistic and motivated they were about their schoolwork, and how they experienced their fathers. The questionnaires were completed primarily by respondents of Mexican American, African American and European American descent. Their maths and language arts grades were also obtained. They were analyzed together with the questionnaire data. The research team took into account the influence that mothers have on their children’s well-being in their analyses.\n\nTheir findings show how fathers can support their teenagers in ways that result in greater optimism, self-efficacy, and, ultimately, higher achievement at school. This is even true for men with low levels of education or those who are not proficient enough in English to help their children with their homework.\n“Low-income fathers affect their adolescents’ beliefs about themselves and their future, and these beliefs influence their achievement by increasing their determination to persist on school tasks,” says Suizzo.\n\nThese positive effects extend to both sons and daughters, albeit in different ways. Experiencing their father’s warmth first influences daughters’ sense of optimism, and then spills over into their feeling more determined and certain about their academic abilities. This in turn leads to better math grades. There is a more direct link between their fathers’ involvement and teenage boys’ belief in their ability to succeed on the academic front. This heightened self-confidence increased their success in English language arts classes.\n\nSuizzo suggests that counselors and educators should encourage fathers to communicate warmth and acceptance to their children, because of the positive influence these emotions have on their well-being.\n\nReference: Suizzo, M.

We investigated the positive beliefs of optimism and academic self-efficacy, and the motivational construct of determination, as possible mediators. Questionnaire data were collected from a sample of 183 sixth-graders (78 male, 105 female) from low-income families: 133 Mexican Americans, 36 African Americans, 11 European Americans, and 3 other ethnicity. Multigroup SEM path analysis was used to test two path models and investigate variations in these models by adolescents\u0026rsquo; gender. Results revealed that, controlling for mothers\u0026rsquo; warmth, fathers\u0026rsquo; warmth predicts adolescents\u0026rsquo; positive beliefs and that these relations vary by adolescents\u0026rsquo; gender. For male adolescents, relations between fathers\u0026rsquo; warmth and English language arts grades are mediated by academic self-efficacy and determination to persist on challenging schoolwork. For female adolescents, relations between fathers\u0026rsquo; warmth and math grades are mediated by optimism and determination. These results demonstrate the unique contributions of fathers\u0026rsquo; warmth to their sons\u0026rsquo; and daughters\u0026rsquo; emotional and academic development. Our study suggests that counselors and educators may positively influence adolescents\u0026rsquo; well-being by encouraging fathers to communicate warmth and acceptance to their adolescents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/theeconomyofmeaning.wordpress.com/5245/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/theeconomyofmeaning.wordpress.com/5245/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=theeconomyofmeaning.com\u0026amp;blog=35260354\u0026amp;post=5245\u0026amp;subd=theeconomyofmeaning\u0026amp;ref=\u0026amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"\u003e","cites_papers":[13697511]}

{"_id":125948347,"body":"A new study published in the Journal of Sex Research shows that roughly one in three college students has made out with someone just to be seen by other people. \n\nMotivations for performative make-outs included: enhancing their image, causing jealousy or envy, demonstrating a relationship, sexually arousing men, and participating in fun and games.","cites_papers":[13878570,13878570]}

{"_id":126006008,"body":"A new study with a sample of about 150 female and 200 male college students finds that 32% of women and 37% of men report having performatively made out for an audience, often before entering college. Perhaps unsurprisingly, women were more likely to report same-sex performative experiences. So, what were some of the motivations for this kind of sexual #exhibitionism? Enhancing one’s image, causing #jealousy or #envy, demonstrating a relationship, sexually arousing men, and participating in #fun and games. Unfortunately, fun and games only go so far: Men reported that their reputations were enhanced more often than damaged by this behavior; women reported the opposite pattern. Seems that the #doublestandard is alive and well even when people are just #kissing.\n#makingout #slutshaming #sexuality #legitsexscience #sexscience #sexresearch #sexsciencenews \nLink to study: ow.ly/nvoY306BH1Z","cites_papers":[13878570]}

{"_id":130063935,"body":"EL PAPEL DE LA BIOLOGÍA SEXUAL DIFERENCIAL EN EL RIESGO DE TRASTORNO DEL ESPECTRO AUTISTA.\nEl trastorno del espectro autista (TEA) es una condición de desarrollo que afecta aproximadamente a cuatro veces más varones que las mujeres, un fuerte sesgo sexual que aún no se ha explicado completamente. \nLa comprensión de las causas de esta prevalencia sesgada puede destacar nuevas vías para el desarrollo del tratamiento que podrían beneficiar a los pacientes con diversos antecedentes genéticos, y la experiencia de los investigadores de diferencias sexuales será inestimable en este esfuerzo. En esta revisión, el  objetivo es evaluar las pruebas actuales relativas a la diferencia de sexo en la prevalencia de TEA y para identificar las cuestiones pendientes y las diferencias restantes en nuestra comprensión de cómo los varones llegan a ser más frecuentemente afectados y / o diagnosticados con TEA.\n Aunque los varones superan sistemáticamente a las mujeres en los estudios de prevalencia de TEA, las estimaciones de prevalencia generadas utilizando diferentes enfoques indican relaciones hombre / mujer de magnitud variable que sugieren que los sesgos de determinación o diagnósticos pueden contribuir a la distorsión masculina en los TEA. Aquí, sepresentan los diferentes métodos aplicados y las implicaciones de sus hallazgos. Además, aunque las estimaciones de prevalencia desafían el grado de predisposición masculina en el TEA, el apoyo está creciendo para el modelo de efecto protector femenino de riesgo de TEA, y se  revisan los resultados relevantes de la tasa de recurrencia, el rasgo cuantitativo y los análisis genéticos. Por último,se  describe el trabajo que investiga varios factores y vías biológicas diferenciados por sexo que pueden ser responsables de la protección de las mujeres y / o aumento del riesgo de los varones predichos por el modelo de efecto protector femenino, incluyendo la exposición y regulación de la hormona esteroide sexual y la actividad sexual diferencial de ciertos tipos de células neuronales. Sin embargo, se necesitará mucho trabajo futuro de las comunidades de investigación de diferencias de sexo y TEA para profundizar nuestra comprensión de cómo estos factores actúan para influir en el cerebro en desarrollo y modular el riesgo de TEA.\nAbstract en inglés\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27891212\nTrabajo completo en inglés\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27891212/\n\nLAS DIFERENCIAS DE SEXO EN LOS TRASTORNOS DEL ESPECTRO AUTISTA.\nOBJETIVO DE LA REVISIÓN:\nSe ha observado un fuerte sesgo masculino en la prevalencia del trastorno del espectro autista (ASD) con sorprendente consistencia, pero ningún mecanismo aún explica definitivamente esta diferencia de sexo. Esta revisión explora el estado actual del trabajo epidemiológico, genético y neuroendocrinológico que aborda la prevalencia de los TEA en varones y mujeres, de modo que enmarque las principales cuestiones necesarias para lograr una comprensión más completa de la base biológica del riesgo diferencial sexual.\nRESULTADOS RECIENTES:\nEstudios recientes continúan reportando un sesgo masculino en la prevalencia de TEA, pero también sugieren que las diferencias de sexo en la presentación fenotípica, incluyendo menos conductas restringidas y repetitivas y externalización de problemas de comportamiento en las mujeres, pueden contribuir a este sesgo. \nLos estudios genéticos demuestran que las mujeres están protegidas de los efectos de variantes de riesgo de TEA hereditarias y de novo, y un trabajo convincente sugiere que los genes cromosómicos sexuales y / o las hormonas sexuales, especialmente la testosterona, pueden modular los efectos de la variación genética en la presentación de un  fenotipo del autismo.\n\nAbstract en inglés\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406909\nTrabajo completo en inglés\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4164392/","cites_papers":[14167592,14167592,1241116,1241116]}

For example, males aspire to careers that require more knowledge of physics, while females prefer ones involving biology. However, no gender differences were found when it came to chemistry-related choices. Additionally, the preferred career choices of men required more mathematical knowledge than those of females, according to data from the Australian sample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just because young women prefer biology careers doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they actually have less aptitude in physics or mathematics when you factor in school grades and \u003ca href=\"http://steamregister.com/artificial-intelligence-takes-the-sat-test/\"\u003estandardized tests\u003c/a\u003e. But young men tend to view their mathematical abilities as more important, and also show more interest in the field. According to Wilson, this could suggest that young men\u0026rsquo;s belief in their own brain power may be inflated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSee Also:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://steamregister.com/bad-at-math-blame-mom-and-dad-rpb/\"\u003eBad At Math?

In the American sample, for instance, the chances were good that a 10th grade girl who did well in the standardized mathematics test set would be contemplating a career involving physics by the 12th grade. In Australia, a young woman\u0026rsquo;s self-belief about her maths skills influenced whether she would consider working in all of the major science fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Girls need to know that they are scoring as well as their male counterparts on these objective measures and that they can be successful in mathematics-intensive careers,\u0026rdquo; Wilson said in a Springer \u003ca href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/research-news/interest--skills-and-belief-in-own-abilities-steer-youngsters-towards-stem-jobs/11109488\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estatement\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://steamregister.com/bad-at-math-blame-mom-and-dad-rpb/\"\u003eParents\u0026rsquo;\u003c/a\u003e perceptions were also found to have a significant impact on their children\u0026rsquo;s future, and many youngsters were found to take careful note of these before making career choices. For example, in the Australian sample, mothers tended to hold their sons\u0026rsquo; mathematical ability in higher regard. However, mothers\u0026rsquo; thoughts about their daughters\u0026rsquo; maths ability were much more tied to actual maths achievements, such as test scores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese findings point to a gender bias in mothers\u0026rsquo; judgments about sons versus daughters, or might reflect differences in the self-concept that male and female adolescents hold of themselves.

Results from this study showed that both #TV exposure and perceived realism of TV content were associated with greater endorsement of gendered sexual scripts, which in turn were associated with lower sexual assertiveness and condom use self-efficacy, as well as sexual #shame. Why? Well, mainstream media are a prominent source of traditional portrayals of women that center on sexual passivity, prioritizing others’ needs, and self-silencing, so acceptance of these roles will lead to a diminishment of sexual agency.\n#sexuality #legitsexscience #sexscience #sexresearch #sexsciencenews \nLink to study: ow.ly/JtCh306O0ni","cites_papers":[14540123]}
