But these expectations (e.g. 25 per cent of infants achieve independent sitting by 5.5 months) are rather misleading because they're derived solely from research on Western babies conducted back in the 1930s and 1940s. \u003ca href=\"http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/46/8/1023\"\u003eA new study\u003c/a\u003e, published recently in the \u003ci\u003eJournal of Cross-Cultural Psychology\u003c/i\u003e, aimed to broaden our understanding of what constitutes typical sitting ability, by observing five-month-old infants from six different cultures: Argentina, Cameroon, Italy, Kenya, South Korea, and the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.csi.cuny.edu/faculty/KARASIK_LANA.html\"\u003eLana Karasik\u003c/a\u003e and her colleagues also departed from previous research by observing babies in their home environment rather than in a psychology lab. Specifically, a researcher local to each of the six cultures visited 12 mother and baby pairs in their homes for one hour. These sessions were taped and coded later based on where the babies were (i.e. in their mothers arms, on the ground, or on baby or adult furniture), their body position (sitting or lying etc) and how close their mother was to them. The mothers didn't know that the study was about infant sitting ability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, one third of the infants were able to sit independently, defined as sitting without support for at least one second. But there was significant cross-cultural variation. For example, just two of the US infants displayed independent sitting and none of the Italian infants, compared with 8 of the Kenyan infants (67 per cent) and 11 of the Cameroonian infants (92 per cent). There was also a wide-range of sitting proficiency, in terms of how long infants sat independently in a single bout. For example, the shortest bout was 2.4 seconds, while the longest was 28 minutes (achieved by a Cameroonian baby).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ctable align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/46/8/1023\"\u003e\u003cimg border=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YsAUX3vMYlg/Vc2nW1DV1-I/AAAAAAAACVQ/EF4o8HEBJ1E/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-08-14%2Bat%2B09.32.03.png\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/46/8/1023\"\u003eFigure from Karasik et al, 2015.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003eThese cultural differences were mirrored by differences in the opportunities the infants were given to sit independently. For example, infants from the US, Argentina, South Korea and Italy spent most of their time in places that provided support, such as a strapped into child's furniture or in their mother's arms. By contrast, infants in Kenya and Cameroon spent most of their sitting time on the floor, or on adult furniture where they had to learn to balance themselves. Mothers in Kenya and Cameroon also tended to spend more time further away from their babies. One Kenyan mother spent 13 minutes out of reach of her baby as he sat independently on adult furniture (by the way, he didn't fall off the furniture, and neither did any other babies in this research).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's tempting to infer that the cultural parenting practices in Kenya and Cameroon may have encouraged some of the infants in those cultures to acquire more precocious sitting abilities (on average). But of course this was a purely observational study with small samples, and we can't know whether the infants' abilities influenced their parents' behaviour or vice versa (in fact, it's probably a bit of both). It's also important to note, as the researchers do, that there was a huge amount of overlap in sitting ability across the cultures (e.g. some US infants sat independently longer than some Kenyan and Cameroonian infants), and there is also a large amount of variation within the cultures. Because of this, Karasik and her team say it is inappropriate to talk of babies in some cultures being \u003ci\u003euniformly\u003c/i\u003e more precocious than babies in others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInfant sitting is a very important skill \u0026ndash; it frees their hands to explore objects and interact more easily with adults.

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"77841264"},"body":"Study uncovers dramatic cross-cultural differences in babies' sitting ability\n\nPaediatricians' offices are often adorned with a developmental milestone chart for infants, and they always show the same \"normal\" age-typical progression, from sitting to crawling to walking. But these expectations (e.g. 25 per cent of infants achieve independent sitting by 5.5 months) are rather misleading because they're derived solely from research on Western babies conducted back in the 1930s and 1940s. A new study, published recently in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, aimed to broaden our understanding of what constitutes typical sitting ability, by observing five-month-old infants from six different cultures: Argentina, Cameroon, Italy, Kenya, South Korea, and the United States.\n\nLana Karasik and her colleagues also departed from previous research by observing babies in their home environment rather than in a psychology lab. Specifically, a researcher local to each of the six cultures visited 12 mother and baby pairs in their homes for one hour. These sessions were taped and coded later based on where the babies were (i.e. in their mothers arms, on the ground, or on baby or adult furniture), their body position (sitting or lying etc) and how close their mother was to them. The mothers didn't know that the study was about infant sitting ability.\n\nOverall, one third of the infants were able to sit independently, defined as sitting without support for at least one second. But there was significant cross-cultural variation. For example, just two of the US infants displayed independent sitting and none of the Italian infants, compared with 8 of the Kenyan infants (67 per cent) and 11 of the Cameroonian infants (92 per cent). There was also a wide-range of sitting proficiency, in terms of how long infants sat independently in a single bout. For example, the shortest bout was 2.4 seconds, while the longest was 28 minutes (achieved by a Cameroonian baby).\n\nFigure from Karasik et al, 2015.\nThese cultural differences were mirrored by differences in the opportunities the infants were given to sit independently. For example, infants from the US, Argentina, South Korea and Italy spent most of their time in places that provided support, such as a strapped into child's furniture or in their mother's arms. By contrast, infants in Kenya and Cameroon spent most of their sitting time on the floor, or on adult furniture where they had to learn to balance themselves. Mothers in Kenya and Cameroon also tended to spend more time further away from their babies. One Kenyan mother spent 13 minutes out of reach of her baby as he sat independently on adult furniture (by the way, he didn't fall off the furniture, and neither did any other babies in this research).\n\nIt's tempting to infer that the cultural parenting practices in Kenya and Cameroon may have encouraged some of the infants in those cultures to acquire more precocious sitting abilities (on average). But of course this was a purely observational study with small samples, and we can't know whether the infants' abilities influenced their parents' behaviour or vice versa (in fact, it's probably a bit of both). It's also important to note, as the researchers do, that there was a huge amount of overlap in sitting ability across the cultures (e.g. some US infants sat independently longer than some Kenyan and Cameroonian infants), and there is also a large amount of variation within the cultures. Because of this, Karasik and her team say it is inappropriate to talk of babies in some cultures being uniformly more precocious than babies in others.\n\nInfant sitting is a very important skill – it frees their hands to explore objects and interact more easily with adults. Given this, it seems amazing that most of what we know about the development of sitting ability is based on dated, lab-based research conducted almost exclusively in Western countries. \"Had we not looked beyond onset ages [the simplistic idea that a child is either a sitter or not], ventured outside the laboratory, and studied samples of infants from six cultures across the globe,\" the researchers said, \"we would never have known that at five months, some infants can safely sit on high benches for extended periods without the support of adults nearby.\"\n\n\n\nKarasik, L., Tamis-LeMonda, C., Adolph, K., \u0026 Bornstein, M.

It accentuates both the prevalence and consequence of bodies being increasingly converted into \u0026lsquo;objects of information\u0026rsquo; by surveillance technologies and systems. We begin by regarding the normalcy of body monitoring in contemporary life, illustrating how a plurality of biometric scanners operate to intermediate the physical surfaces and subjective depths of bodies in accordance with various concerns. We focus on everyday experiences of bodily intermediation by surveillant dispositifs, and consider the broader political, epistemological, and ontological significance of these processes. We then point to the substantive intersections and divergences existing between body and surveillance studies. We conclude with an overview of the five articles appearing in this special issue. We describe how each contribution creates a template for imagining what a body is, and what a body might become, in a culture defined by proliferating data sharing behaviours, systems of codification, and practices of intermediation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bod.sagepub.com/content/22/2/28.short\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSurveillance, Privacy and the Making of the Modern Subject:\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eHabeas\u003c/em\u003e what kind of \u003cem\u003eCorpus\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCharlotte Epstein\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article I consider how our experiences of bodily privacy are changing in the contemporary surveillance society. I use biometric technologies as a lens for tracking the changing relationships between the body and privacy. Adopting a broader genealogical perspective, I retrace the role of the body in the constitution of the modern liberal political subject. I consider two different understandings of the subject, the Foucauldian political subject, and the Lacanian psychoanalytic subject. The psychoanalytic perspective serves to appraise the importance of hiding for the subject effects of excessive exposure to the Other\u0026rsquo;s gaze. I conclude to the importance of the subject\u0026rsquo;s being able to hide, even when it has nothing to hide. By considering these two facets of subjectivity, political and psychic, I hope to make sense of our enduring and deeply political passionate attachment to privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bod.sagepub.com/content/22/2/58.short\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBig Data Surveillance and the Body-subject\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKirstie Ball, MariaLaura Di Domenico, Daniel Nunan\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis paper considers the implications of big data practices for theories about the surveilled subject who, analysed from afar, is still gazed upon, although not directly watched as with previous surveillance systems. We propose this surveilled subject be viewed through a lens of proximity rather than interactivity, to highlight the normative issues arising within digitally mediated relationships. We interpret the ontological proximity between subjects, data flows and big data surveillance through Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s ideas combined with Levinas\u0026rsquo; approach to ethical proximity and Coeckelberg\u0026rsquo;s work on proximity in the digital age. This leads us to highlight how competing normativities, and normative dilemmas in these proximal spaces, manipulate the surveilled subject\u0026rsquo;s embodied practices to lead the embodied individual towards experiencing them in a local sense. We explore when and how the subject notices these big data practices and then interprets them through translating their experiences into courses of action, inaction or acquiescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bod.sagepub.com/content/22/2/82.short\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHIV, Viral Suppression and New Technologies of Surveillance and Control\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAdrian Guta, Stuart J Murray, Marilou Gagnon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global response to managing the spread of HIV has recently undergone a significant shift with the advent of \u0026lsquo;treatment as prevention\u0026rsquo;, a strategy which presumes that scaling-up testing and treatment for people living with HIV will produce a broader preventative benefit. Treatment as prevention includes an array of diagnostic, technological and policy developments that are creating new understandings of how HIV circulates in bodies and spaces. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, we contextualize these developments by linking them to systems of governance and discursive subjectivation. The goal of this article is to problematize the growing importance of viral suppression in the management of HIV and the use of related surveillance technologies. For people living with HIV, we demonstrate how treatment-as-prevention\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on individual and collective viral load is transforming the performative dimensions of embodied risk, affect, subjectivity and sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bod.sagepub.com/content/22/2/108.short\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSurveillance, Data and Embodiment: On the Work of Being Watched\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGavin JD Smith\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s bodies are akin to \u0026lsquo;walking sensor platforms\u0026rsquo;. Bodies either host, or are the subjects of, an array of sensing devices that act to convert bodily movements, actions and dynamics into circulative data. This article proposes the notions of \u0026lsquo;disembodied exhaust\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;embodied exhaustion\u0026rsquo; to conceptualise processes of bodily sensorisation and datafication. As the material body interfaces with networked sensor technologies and sensing infrastructures, it emits disembodied exhaust: gaseous flows of personal information that establish a representational data-proxy. It is this networked actant that progressively structures how embodied subjects experience their daily lives. The significance of this symbiont medium in determining the outcome of interplays between networked individuals and audiences necessitates that it is carefully contrived. The article explores the nature and function of the data-proxy, and its impact on social relations. Drawing on examples that depict individuals engaging with their data-proxies, the article suggests that managing a virtual presence is analogous to a work relation, demanding diligence and investment. But it also shows how the data-proxy operates as a mode of affect that challenges conventional distinctions made between organic and inorganic bodies, agency and actancy, mortality and immortality, presence and absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bod.sagepub.com/content/22/2/140.short\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReading the Human Brain: How the Mind Became Legible\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNikolas Rose\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human body was made legible long ago. But what of the human mind? Is it possible to \u0026lsquo;read\u0026rsquo; the mind, for one human being to know what another is thinking or feeling, their beliefs and intentions. And if I can read your mind, how about others \u0026ndash; could our authorities, in the criminal justice system or the security services? Some developments in contemporary neuroscience suggest the answer to this question is \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;. While philosophers continue to debate the mind-brain problem, a range of novel technologies of brain imaging have been used to argue that specific mental states, and even specific thoughts, can be identified by characteristic patterns of brain activation; this has led some to propose their use in practices ranging from lie detection and security screening to the assessment of brain activity in persons in persistent vegetative states. This article reviews the history of these developments, sketches their scientific and technical bases, considers some of the epistemological and ontological mutations involved, explores the ecological niches where they have found a hospitable environment, and considers some implications of this materialization of the readable, knowable, transparent mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mh.bmj.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMedical Humanities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mh.bmj.com/content/42/2/73.short?g=w_mh_current_tab\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEditorial:\u0026nbsp;Perspectives on patienthood, practitioners and pedagogy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCiara Breathnach, Brendan D Kelly\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue brings together scholars of philosophy, medicine, history, art history and psychiatry to consider the theme of \u0026lsquo;patienthood\u0026rsquo;, to ponder what being a patient means in historic and modern terms, to discuss the practitioner/patient relationship, to contribute to pedagogy and ongoing debates in the medical humanities.

Rather than examine the relationship between the long dead martyrs (whose relics were abundant), however, it will look at the relationship between relatively recent saints and their devotees. The miracles discussed are traditional\u0026mdash;that is, they are found in the lives of many saints and are not exceptional. It is hoped, however, that by concentrating on Tuscany, some insights can be secured on the relationship between Tuscan individuals of the late middle ages and those of their community who were recognised, either officially or through vox populi, as saints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mh.bmj.com/content/42/2/81.abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedicine, belief, witchcraft and demonic possession in late seventeenth-century Ulster\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAndrew Sneddon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIreland\u0026rsquo;s only published witchcraft pamphlet, written by Daniel Higgs, The Wonderful and True Relation of the Bewitching of a Young Girle in Ireland, What Ways she was Tormented, and a Receipt of the Ointment that she was Cured with (1699), works within the confines of late seventeenth-century demonology, while upholding the patriarchy of the fledgling Protestant Ascendancy. More importantly, it provides rare insight into early modern Protestant witchcraft beliefs, highlights the limits of contemporary medical care and provision and details the pathways of self-medication people resorted to. Higgs\u0026rsquo; method of promoting self-medication as a cure to bewitchment and demonic possession was based on a remedy described in an obscure Renaissance magical text. To promote his \u0026lsquo;cure\u0026rsquo; the pamphlet included a particularly vitriolic critique of the established Irish medical profession, as self-regarding and incompetent witchcraft deniers. This article uses Higgs\u0026rsquo; pamphlet to explore the limits to/of medical knowledge in early modern Ireland and Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mh.bmj.com/content/42/2/87.abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSearching for the patient\u0026rsquo;s voice in the Irish asylums\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBrendan D Kelly\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe history of mental healthcare in Ireland ends to focus on the histories of institutions and development of mental health legislation. Attention has also been devoted to clinical records, with all of their interpretative and narrative complexities. In both the historiography and archives, however, patients themselves remain remarkably elusive, their voices astonishingly distant. In countries other than Ireland, there have been more extensive analyses of patients\u0026rsquo; letters, journals and first-person accounts of hospitalisation and treatment. In Ireland, there is real difficulty accessing such accounts, if they exist, especially from the 1800s. Asylum and hospital records offer some assistance in understanding patients\u0026rsquo; concerns and, arguably, the symptoms recorded in asylum records (eg, delusions) provide further windows into patients\u0026rsquo; minds. Methodological challenges abound, but while patients\u0026rsquo; voices may remain largely unknown at present, they are certainly not unknowable.

As with experiences of art, or of humour, or of love, or of strong ethical motivation, in experiences of wonder it seems to me that we live more intensely. And if it is a good thing to live, then perhaps living intensely may, while it lasts, be an intensely good thing.

It is argued that the humanities (especially, literature) help to foster insights beyond those provided by biomedical training. Healthy young medics, it is claimed, can thereby gain significant insights into patienthood, and obtain important skills that may be valuable for their professional life. But the instrumentality of the humanities is not the only justification proffered for its inclusion in medical curricula. In this paper I critically examine the two overarching justifications recurrently cited in the mainstream literature\u0026mdash;namely, (1) the instrumental worth and (2) the intrinsic value of the medical humanities in educating doctors. Examining these theses (and focusing on the views of a leading medical humanities scholar) I show that the bifurcation into instrumental versus non-instrumental justifications is not supported by the argumentation. Instead, I find that the particulars of the supposedly intrinsic justifications amount to an unambiguously instrumental defence of the humanities. Contextualizing the present investigation to probe further, I describe a long history of debate about the role of the humanities in British education and find that it rests on unsupported dichotomies (utility vs non-utility, theoretical vs applied, educated vs trained). I conclude that the medical humanities\u0026rsquo; manifesto would be more intellectually honest and coherent, and provide a more robust defence of its value in medical education, if it chose to embrace a wholly instrumental rationale for its role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mh.bmj.com/content/42/2/109.abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRethinking the medical in the medical humanities\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDesmond O\u0026rsquo;Neill, Elinor Jenkins, Rebecca Mawhinney, Ellen Cosgrave, Sarah O\u0026rsquo;Mahony, Clare Guest, Hilary Moss\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo clinicians there are a number of striking features of the ever-evolving field of the medical humanities. The first is a perception of a predominantly unidirectional relationship between medicine and the humanities, generally in terms of what the arts and humanities have to offer medicine. The second is the portrayal of medical practice in terms of problems and negativities for which the medical humanities are seen to pose the solution rather than viewing medicine as an active and positive contributor to an interdisciplinary project. Paradigms that fail to recognise the contributions of medicine and its practitioners (including students) to the medical humanities, this paper argues, will continue to struggle with definition and acceptance. This paper explores the possibilities for advancing the medical humanities through recognition of the contribution of medicine to the humanities and the importance of engaging with the arts, culture and leisure pursuits of doctors and medical students. Our research shows the richness of cultural engagement of medical students, their broad range of cultural interests and their ability to contribute to research and scholarship in the medical humanities. Mutual recognition of strengths, weaknesses and differences of scholarly approach is critical to successful development of the enterprise. Recognising and building on the interests, sympathies and contributions of medicine and its practitioners to the medical humanities is a fundamental component of this task. Future directions might include introductory courses for humanities scholars in aspects of healthcare and medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mh.bmj.com/content/42/2/115.abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedical humanities: a closer look at learning\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Patterson, D Sharek, M Hennessy, M Phillips, S Schofield\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inclusion of medical humanities with medical curricula is a question that has been the focus of attention for many within the evolving field. This study addressed the question from a medical education perspective and aimed to investigate what students at Trinity College Dublin learned from participating in a short medical humanities student-selected module in their first year of an undergraduate medical programme. A total of 156 students provided a written reflection on a memorable event that occurred during their student-selected module. The reflections were analysed using the Reflection Evaluation for Learners\u0026rsquo; Enhanced Competencies Tool (REFLECT) and through qualitative thematic analysis of the written reflections. Evidence of learning from the REFLECT quantitative analysis showed that 50% of students displayed higher levels of reflection when describing their experience. The reflection content analysis supported the heterogeneous nature of learning outcome for students, with evidence to support the idea that the module provided opportunities for students to explore their beliefs, ideas and feelings regarding a range of areas outside their current experience or world view, to consider the views of others that they may have not previously been aware of, to reflect on their current views, and to consider their future professional practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9566\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSociology of Health \u0026amp; Illness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.12451/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEditorial: Childbirth and Reproduction\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGareth Williams and Ian Rees Jones\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.12400/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe sociology of childbirth: an autobiographical journey through four decades of research\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnn Oakley\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sociology of childbirth emerged in the 1970s largely as a result of influences from outside sociology.

Recently, however, medicalisation scholarship has begun studying men. This burgeoning literature heavily emphasises sexuality and is beginning to focus on medicalised masculinities in which traits associated with masculinity are deemed a health risk. Such research has demonstrated how masculinities shape men\u0026rsquo;s lived experiences of health, but how does health itself shape masculinity? I explore this question using the case of infertility. Through thirty in-depth interviews, I find that men use medicine as a way to achieve rather than diminish their sense of masculinity in the feminised context of reproduction. By perpetuating the stereotype that infertility is a woman\u0026rsquo;s problem, the medical establishment has caused men to not necessarily see themselves as infertile. Additionally, even if men do claim the infertility status, they do not perceive it as negative. The legitimating effects of medicalisation objectify the ailment and separate its connection with sexuality. In centring men\u0026rsquo;s voices, the study not only reveals men as active players in the reproductive process, but also incorporates them into understandings of medicalisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.12392/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026lsquo;We needed to change the mission statement of the marriage\u0026rsquo;: biographical disruptions, appraisals and revisions among couples living with endometriosis\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNicky Hudson, Lorraine Culley, Caroline Law, Helene Mitchell, Elaine Denny, Nick Raine-Fenning\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of biographical disruption has been widely applied in sociological explorations of chronic illness and has been subject to much theoretical scrutiny, reflection and development. However, little attention has been given to the impact of biographical disruption beyond the individual level. This article explores the concept from a dyadic perspective, utilising data from an exploratory, qualitative study (ENDOPART) that investigated the impact of endometriosis on women and their male partners. In total, 22 couples participated in in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. The women and their partners were interviewed separately and, in most cases, simultaneously, by different interviewers. Data analysis was informed by an interpretivist relational approach, foregrounding the meanings participants applied to their experiences, treating interviews as accounts, and exploring partners\u0026rsquo; accounts in relation to one another. Two analytic approaches generated several themes for exploration in the context of the concept of biographical disruption: sex and intimacy; planning for and having children; working lives and social lives. The article argues that biographical disruptions are social and inter-relational processes and discusses how couples living with endometriosis negotiated these disruptions, how they were appraised and how lives and expectations were revised as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.12398/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026lsquo;You\u0026rsquo;re looking for different parts in a jigsaw\u0026rsquo;: foetal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) as an emerging technology in professional practice \u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e(open access)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKate Reed, Inna Kochetkova, Susan Molyneux-Hodgson\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was first introduced into clinical practice during the 1980s. Originally used as a diagnostic tool to take pictures of the brain, spine, and joints, it is now used to visualise a range of organs and soft tissue around the body. Developments in clinical applications of the technology are rapid and it is often viewed as the \u0026lsquo;gold standard\u0026rsquo; in many areas of medicine. However, most existing sociological work on MRI tends to focus on the profession of radiology, little is known about the impact of MRI on a broader range of clinical practice. This article focuses on MRI use in pregnancy, a relatively new application of the technology. Drawing on empirical research with a range of health professionals (from radiologists to pathologists) in the North of England, this article asks: how do different types of health professionals engage with the technology and to what end? It will argue that MRI use in pregnancy offers an increasingly important piece of the diagnostic jigsaw, often acting as a bridging technology between medical specialties.

However, research has shown that genetic information is interpreted and acted upon through a rich repertoire of adaptable social, cultural and familial factors which pre-exist and interact with biomedical knowledge. This paper reports research into families living with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a highly uncertain condition the manifestation of which can vary considerably also within the same family and, for this reason, has been defined as a \u0026lsquo;condition without parameters\u0026rsquo;. These characteristics make NF1 a particularly informative condition for the examination of family dynamics around genetic information. The study and the methodology are based on the exploration of family networks and allow us to investigate the interrelation of individual and familial constructions of the uncertainty of NF1.

Most nations have historically been homogeneous in terms of race, ethnicity, and religion. There just isn't as much data historically on how multiculturalism works, or if it works. I know that pretty much all racially diverse countries now aren't paradise, groups don't share resources evenly and there is lots of problems with crime and inequality. Homogeneous nations seem to have more functional governments as most people share the same core values.Sources:The Evolutionary Dominance of Ethnocentric Cooperation Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 16 (3) 7 DOI: 10.18564/jasss.2176 Received: 31-Mar-2012 Accepted: 28-Dec-2012 Published: 30-Jun-2013 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/16/3/7.htmlEvolution of contingent altruism when cooperation is expensive Ross A.

Policies haven't changed that much yet, but the set of ideas that drive movements and activism and the public discussion have altered radically in the last few years. In the U.S., which of course I know the best, there have been new outpourings on the left - the resurgent socialist movement and the social justice movement chief among them. But as far as I can see, the biggest new thing is the alt-right. Loosely (we can argue about definitions all day, and I'm sure many of you will want to do so), the alt-right wants to make American society homogeneous. Most of the enthusiasm is for racial homogeneity, but religion seems to figure into it a bit as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe siren song of homogeneity is a powerful one. On Twitter and elsewhere, I am encountering more and more young people (mostly men) who openly yearn for a society where everyone is white. The more reasonable among these young people tell me that homogeneity reduces conflict, increases social trust, and has a number of other benefits. They often cite Japan as their paradigmatic homogeneous society; some explicitly say they want a white version of Japan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the reasonable ones - the less reasonable ones tend to communicate in memes, threats, and slurs (\"Fuck you, Jew! How about open boarders for ISRAEL!!\", etc.). But the fact that these men are dedicating so much time, effort, and passion into \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqVanJab9rt5BBBK0iEfyw\"\u003ethose memes\u003c/a\u003e, threats and slurs says something important.

Perhaps it still is a fringe notion - after all, social media acts as a force multiplier that allows a \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/19/new-report-2-6-million-anti-semitic-tweets-in-one-year.html\"\u003erelatively small number\u003c/a\u003e of highly committed individuals to seem like a huge army. And perhaps this kind of sentiment was always reasonably common in America, but simply kept under wraps by the mainstream media before the internet emerged to make it more visible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is some evidence to support the contention that alt-right ideas are still highly unpopular in America. \u003ca href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/12/in-views-of-diversity-many-europeans-are-less-positive-than-americans/\"\u003eA 2016 Pew survey found\u003c/a\u003e that only 7 percent of Americans say that growing diversity makes the country a worse place to live:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qxdHfBNdjhs/WQEqtkutGII/AAAAAAAAJx0/NCeoogfQb9IpAHR9wBkv6APJvKKNlNkzQCLcB/s1600/diversity.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qxdHfBNdjhs/WQEqtkutGII/AAAAAAAAJx0/NCeoogfQb9IpAHR9wBkv6APJvKKNlNkzQCLcB/s400/diversity.png\" title=\"Hey Greece, how's that \u0026quot;doing anything interesting or noteworthy since the birth of Christ\u0026quot; thing coming along?\" width=\"357\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eCompare that to 31 percent in Britain and Germany and 36 percent in the Netherlands!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-back-immigration-and-trade-at-record-levels-1493092861\"\u003erecent polls find support for immigration\u003c/a\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pDqway1jiy4/WQErtOCWk7I/AAAAAAAAJx8/pytG7-6TGCALZB1NU8ezhDHkYKVbyM8EgCLcB/s1600/immigration.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"258\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pDqway1jiy4/WQErtOCWk7I/AAAAAAAAJx8/pytG7-6TGCALZB1NU8ezhDHkYKVbyM8EgCLcB/s400/immigration.png\" title=\"MOAR\" width=\"400\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThat's a short time series, so \u003ca href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx\"\u003ehere's a longer one from Gallup\u003c/a\u003e.

That implies that much of what anti-immigrant sentiment does exist is not due to a growing yearning for a homogeneous white nation. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-05-19/whites-surprisingly-chill-about-becoming-minority\"\u003esubstantial majority\u003c/a\u003e of white Americans supports letting undocumented immigrants stay, as long as certain conditions are met - that doesn't exactly seem like a vote for white homogeneity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it's certainly \u003ci\u003epossible\u003c/i\u003e that the alt-right - even defined very generally, including the more moderate \"alt-light\" and the quietly sympathetic \"alt-white\" - is a shrinking, dying idea that is only becoming louder and more aggressive \u003ca href=\"https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/07/extinction-burst/\"\u003ebecause it's under threat\u003c/a\u003e. It's possible that Trump's election was really driven more by people's economic hopes that he would bring back dying industries and bring American jobs back from overseas, or even just by a desire to roll the dice of change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I think that whether or not the alt-right is really a growing, burgeoning movement, it makes sense to take it and its ideas seriously. First, the presence of Trump in the White House will probably force much of the country to listen to what the alt-right has to say. Even though \u003ca href=\"https://www.dailystormer.com/if-marine-le-pen-loses/\"\u003ehe isn't really their man\u003c/a\u003e, he has hired several people who at least loosely sympathize with the movement's ideas - Bannon, Miller, Anton and Gorka among them. That means that at least as long as Trump's butt is planted in a chair in the Oval Office, alt-right ideas have at least a chance of making it into government policy. That means the alt-right, and their ideas, matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even beyond that, I feel an emotional desire to engage with the alt-right - at least, the more reasonable among them. I couldn't care less about the people in Europe supporting Le Pen or Geert Wilders, but alt-right Americans are my countrymen. I'm a nationalist at heart and I care about what my countrymen think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I think that there are a decent of young (mostly) men out there whose intellectual lives will be defined by this stuff - who will spend their 20s and 30s entranced by the idea of a homogeneous white society. Just as there are old hippies who still look at the world through the lens of the 1960s anti-war movement, in a few decades there will be some aging white Millennial men for whom Pepe the Frog and r/thedonald and Kekistan and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/52h67u/daddy_what_did_you_do_during_the_great_meme_war/\"\u003eGreat Meme War\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;were the climax of their youthful energy and imagination. I want to engage with those people, even if (as I predict) they ultimately lose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eIs the alt-right really a pro-homogeneity movement? Is Trumpism?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery movement is...well, heterogeneous. Alt-right people talk a lot about homogeneity, but it's certainly not the only thing they talk about, or the only reason for their movement. Some may join the alt-right simply out of a fear of the social justice movement - banding together for mutual defense. Others may simply be opposed to some group of immigrants - someone who would be fine with a Cuban neighbor might be terrified of a Syrian one. Still others may be religious traditionalists looking for a home after the collapse of the Christian right, neo-Confederates allied to an Old South style of racial politics or just Trump fans looking for a cool club to join. For some, \"homogeneity\" might be simply a convenient rallying cry for expelling undesirable groups from the country, or for instituting one's chosen value system. As for Trumpism, that almost certainly has multiple causes - anything as big and all-encompassing as a presidential election will have multiple causes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I think research shows that fear of ethnic heterogeneity is a real driver of Trump support. For example, \u003ca href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430216677304?journalCode=gpia\"\u003ethis study shows\u003c/a\u003e that reminding white people with strong white identification that America is getting less white (which might not actually be true, but we'll get to that later) increased support for Trump. And anecdotally, support for homogeneity pops up again and again in pro-Trump literature and discourse. Here's a quote from Trump advisor Michael Anton's famous essay \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/the-flight-93-election/\"\u003eThe Flight 93 Election\u003c/a\u003e,\" widely considered to be one of the basic Trumpist manifestos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eThird and most important, the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle. As does, of course, the U.S. population[.]\u003c/blockquote\u003eSo I'd say the case is fairly clear that the desire for a homogeneous society runs strong through both the alt-right and the broader Trump movement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe data-based case for homogeneity\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe case for homogeneity comes down to the idea that a homogeneous society is a nicer place to live. Alt-right people cite Japan's \u003ca href=\"http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Japan/United-States/Crime\"\u003estunningly low crime rate\u003c/a\u003e, for example, as evidence that ethnically similar people don't fight. They also claim that homogeneity increases social trust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a reasonably large body of research that supports the \"trust\" idea.

Maybe people who belong to different groups have different interests. Maybe we just generally fear that which is different and strange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of this appeal to evidence, however, there's an emotional appeal - as there always is for any really important political idea. There's the negative appeal of fear of diversity - the specter of becoming a minority, potentially hated, despised, and/or oppressed by other groups. But there also seems to be a yearning for a half-imagined utopia - a \"Japan for white people\", where shared whiteness produces a neighborly camaraderie, social cohesion, and peace that is unknown in much of modern America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eCaveats to the data-based case for homogeneity\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoissy is a polemic blogger; his aim is to advocate, not to educate. The academic case for homogeneity is not nearly as clear-cut as what he presents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of the studies he cites have methodological issues. For example, \u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/juaf.12015/abstract\"\u003eone study finds\u003c/a\u003e that \"neighborly exchange\" is negatively correlated with diversity. But its data set doesn't allow it to compare recently diversified neighborhoods with neighborhoods that recently received a lot of \u003ci\u003einternal\u003c/i\u003e in-migration - in other words, it may simply be that a flood of newcomers, be they the same race as the majority or not, tends to disrupt neighborly friendships. In fact most of the cited studies tend to have this problem - it's hard to distinguish between the impact of population mobility and the impact of diversity itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther studies he cites show some cases in which ethnic diversity increases trust. For example, \u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2010.00215.x/abstract\"\u003ea study in America\u003c/a\u003e found a U-shaped relationship between ethnic fractionalization and trust, meaning that high and low diversity places tend to have more trust than medium-diversity places (which makes sense if medium-diversity places are places where a bunch of newcomers just showed up).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, it's worth noting that many of the studies Roissy cites are from Europe. It may be the case that Europe functions differently than America, and is not an appropriate comparison. Most Europeans may think of their societies as based on ethnicity - \"blood and soil\", as some say - while this may hold true for only a minority of Americans. Also, recent European nonwhite immigration may be very different from the type of nonwhite immigration America gets - where America has recently mostly taken in\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-speyer/latinos-work-hard_b_1587197.html\"\u003ehard-working Hispanics\u003c/a\u003e and\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/\"\u003ehigh-skilled Asians\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and Africans, Europe has tended to take a lot of lower-skilled Middle Easterners and North Africans. Not only might the latter tend to be a more fractious type of immigrant, but there's also an enmity between Europe and the MENA region that \u003ca href=\"http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/11/steve-bannon-and-new-crusade.html\"\u003egoes back further\u003c/a\u003e than reliably recorded history. That could contribute to the distrust. In other words, the \u003ci\u003ekind\u003c/i\u003e of diversity you get probably matters a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there are all of the contrary studies Roissy, as a polemic blogger, doesn't cite. It's a big literature, and there are lots of findings that go in the other direction. For example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.

There's also a big literature on \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/diversity-makes-you-brighter.html\"\u003ediversity and group decision-making\u003c/a\u003e, most (but not all) of which concludes that ethnic diversity makes groups smarter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could go on - most of this is the result of me just doing Google Scholar searches for \"diversity and trust\" and \"diversity and social capital\" and picking out any studies on the first page or two that seem to contradict the \"diversity decreases trust\" conclusion. That's hardly a scientific way to proceed, but it does show that if you get your academic information from a polemicist, you're going to get a distorted picture of the academic literature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy point here is not to say that the alt-right is wrong about homogeneity and trust. They might be right - my sense from reading literature surveys is that the correlation between homogeneity and trust is a common finding, but not overwhelmingly common. My point here is to say that the question of homogeneity and trust is not yet answered. This is not surprising, because both homogeneity and trust are big, expansive, vaguely defined concepts, which usually means clear-cut answers don't exist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing that bothers me about many of these studies is that I tend to be a bit skeptical of survey research. This is not to say survey research is worthless, but I guess like any good economist I instinctively put more stock in measures of actual behavior. Roissy's link list does include some studies showing diversity increases conflict, but to my knowledge, \u003ca href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S1521-6136%282009%290000013004\"\u003ethe academic consensus is that immigration reduces crime\u003c/a\u003e. That literature review is from a few years back, but recent research all seems to \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/immigrants-do-not-increase-crime-research-shows/\"\u003econfirm the finding\u003c/a\u003e. To me, lower crime is a much more tangible result than people simply saying negative things on a survey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut an even more important reason why you shouldn't put too much stock in this literature is that almost none of these studies are very good at dealing with \u003ci\u003eendogeneity\u003c/i\u003e. Here are some examples of endogeneity issues:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Suppose low-skilled immigrants tend to move to areas with low social trust, because businesses in places with low social cohesion tend to hire cheap labor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Suppose large empires tend to conquer lots of different ethnicities and encourage internal migration that increases local ethnic diversity, but suppose that large empires also tend to collapse, causing lots of local conflicts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Suppose exogenous events that cause waves of newcomers - conflicts, recessions, out-migration from declining areas - are also things that tend to reduce trust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo really control for these kinds of things, you really need natural experiments. They already do this for things like the impact of immigration on wages. But to isolate the effect of ethnic diversity from the effect of population mobility - i.e., to tell the difference between \"newcomers of any race\" and \"newcomers of a minority race\" - will require finding some situation where different ethnicities of newcomers are randomly assigned to different areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Update: Someone forwarded me \u003ca href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/686010\"\u003ethis paper\u003c/a\u003e showing that when housing is randomly assigned in France, diversity is correlated with \"social anomie\", which apparently increases vandalism but reduces violent conflict. Interesting! Keep in mind that this might be specific to the types of people who live in France.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, so this is all important to think about. But to me, the really interesting question is whether ethnicity itself is endogenous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore on that later, though. First, let's shift gears from data to anecdote, so I can talk about my experiences living in an ethnically homogeneous society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eMy own experience in a homogeneous society\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs regular blog readers know, I've live in Japan (for a total of about 3.5 years). Though I'm of course not Japanese, the experience taught me much about how Japanese people live and think. So I have observed at least one good example of a homogeneous society up close. While that example might not generalize, here are my thoughts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, if you think Japanese people share a sense of camaraderie and togetherness from all being the same ethnicity, think again. Because Japan is homogeneous, ethnicity just isn't that salient to most Japanese people - when a Japanese person meets another Japanese person, they don't think \"Japanese person,\" they just think \"person\". Ethnic identity isn't on their minds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this, ethnic homogeneity creates very little solidarity on a day-to-day basis in Japan. Japanese people are generally wary of striking up conversations with strangers - more wary than Americans of different races are of striking up conversations with each other, I find. Services like Craigslist that facilitate informal transactions between private parties are rarely used - when I ask Japanese people why, they say it's because they can't trust strangers. Some Japanese people have told me that they feel far less shy talking to a foreigner than they do talking to another Japanese person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suspect that the feeling of ethnic solidarity that many alt-right whites feel for other alt-right whites is something unique to minorities. People who have always been part of the overwhelming majority just don't think about ethnicity enough for it to create bonds of solidarity - except in extreme situations, like a foreign war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurveys corroborate my hunch. Japan has always reported relatively \u003ca href=\"http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp\"\u003elow levels of interpersonal trust\u003c/a\u003e - until recently, considerably lower than in the U.S.:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a5KuxX542jI/WQKlPjdpO_I/AAAAAAAAJyY/2JUkCfIl0fo-hvqbRtANUj689XrSRnFRACLcB/s1600/trust1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a5KuxX542jI/WQKlPjdpO_I/AAAAAAAAJyY/2JUkCfIl0fo-hvqbRtANUj689XrSRnFRACLcB/s400/trust1.png\" title=\"Diversity had sent American trust plunging all the way to Japanese levels!\" width=\"400\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow keep in mind, that's trust, which is very different from \u003ci\u003etrustworthiness\u003c/i\u003e. Japanese people, as a rule, are some of the most scrupulously honest people I've ever met. I've had old Japanese women run to catch up with me on the street, handing me a penny I dropped. The one time I dropped a substantial amount of cash on the ground, it was a yakuza bodyguard who notified me. Japanese people generally\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003edeserve\u003c/i\u003e high trust, but don't necessarily give it to each other.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eUrban Japan also seems to me to have little tradition of \"neighborly exchange\" (I'm sure this is different in small towns, but Japan is very highly urbanized). I see very few people saying hello to their neighbors. One person I knew who did this was considered eccentric.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo if you think a homogeneous society means that people will tip their hat to you on the street and be you're friend just because you're the same race as them, think again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHowever, Japanese culture also has quite a lot of unwritten rules, which almost everyone follows. Some of these are speech rules - the famous Japanese \"politeness\". Some are rules about work - the famous Japanese \"corporate culture\". Some are rules about service in restaurants and shops. There are many others.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThese rules - which people sometimes mistakenly label \"conformity\" - would be harder to turn into universal norms in the diverse United States. Foreigners, or people from other parts of the country, might just not know the rules. And people from certain ethnic backgrounds might resent being pressured to follow those rules by people of other ethnic backgrounds, and so might intentionally disobey. The less other people follow a social rule, the less incentive there is for me to follow it.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo Japanese homogeneity seems to produce a society where everyone's minor, day-to-day interaction is a little more \u003ci\u003epredictable\u003c/i\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHow about politics? Japan has long been dominated by a single political party (the LDP), and politics is traditionally conducted via factions within that ruling party. There's little question in my mind that homogeneity is one of the causes of one-party dominance - there's no ethnic minority to form the core of an opposition party.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo how does that work out? Japanese politics is famously dysfunctional - the debt is out of control, patronage politics is rife, and there's usually a dearth of leadership. This was as true before World War 2 as it is today - Japan in the 30s was afflicted with frequent \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Attempted_coups_in_Japan\"\u003ecoup attempts\u003c/a\u003e and plenty of extremism, and essentially bumbled its way into multiple disastrous wars. Nowadays, Japanese political dysfunctionality is more likely to manifest itself as wasteful spending and obstruction of needed economic reforms.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHowever, it's worth noting that Japan has not experienced a \"populist backlash\" like other countries. Shinzo Abe is a true nationalist leader, and a responsible one. He was \u003ca href=\"https://japantoday.com/category/politics/abe-criticizes-hate-speech\"\u003equick to quell\u003c/a\u003e outbursts of racism against those minorities that do exist in Japan, and in general has a pretty \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-06-11/japan-s-abe-is-the-world-s-best-leader\"\u003eprogressive agenda\u003c/a\u003e. And overall, Japanese people are (so far) \u003ca href=\"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/23/national/politics-diplomacy/telephone-survey-finds-abe-cabinet-approval-rate-rises-despite-ministers-gaffes-scandal/\"\u003epretty happy\u003c/a\u003e with Abe. He's worlds away from a Trump or a Le Pen or an Erdogan or a Chavez. So it's possible that homogeneity exerts a stabilizing effect on Japanese politics, insulating it from periodic outbreaks of madness, while making it less responsive in normal times due to the lack of a credible opposition.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAs for crime, everyone knows that Japan is an extraordinarily safe country. It's hard for people who've never lived there to wrap their heads around how safe it is - teenage girls walk the streets of major cities alone at night in schoolgirl skirts and fear absolutely nothing. Is Japan so nonviolent because of its homogeneity? It's hard to say. In America, immigration - which is usually nonwhite immigration - tends to \u003ca href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S1521-6136%282009%290000013004\"\u003edecrease crime\u003c/a\u003e. The ultra-diverse New York City and Los Angeles are some of the lowest-crime cities in America. Also, Japan does have a few very diverse neighborhoods, and these are also quite safe. So my instinct is to say that Japan's secret safety sauce is something else. But I don't really know.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo overall, if I were to draw conclusions from my experience in Japan, I'd say that homogeneity has its advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately isn't clearly better or worse. Japan is one of the awesomest, nicest places I've ever been, but the other top contenders are diverse places like Vancouver, Austin, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e(As an aside, if I were making policy, I'd recommend that Japan not take in mass immigration. Maybe their society could handle it, maybe it couldn't - but I say, no need to mess with a good thing. But that's also why I recommend that America and Canada keep taking in lots of immigrants - we've got a different kind of good thing going. Anyway, that's my instinct.)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow racial is homogeneity?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut here's one coda, which leads into my next point. Are Japanese people all the same race? Maybe not. Japan was formed from the confluence of two groups, the Jomon (unusually densely populated hunter-gatherers) and the Yayoi (rice farmers). This genetic mixing is \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26510569\"\u003estill very apparent\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;in the genetic data.\u0026nbsp;And perhaps as a result of this, you see a reasonably large diversity of features in Japanese people.

In other words, this theory says that homogeneity isn't the means, it's the goal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWho knows; one day even white and black Americans might consider themselves part of the same ethnic group.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe dream of a white nation\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut what about the people who don't \u003ci\u003ewant\u003c/i\u003e that? What about the alt-right folks and fellow-travelers who have no intention of waiting around for America's various races to all decide they're on the same team? Many want to take the shortcut to a homogeneous society - they want to live in a place where only white people are allowed. They want the dream of a half-remembered, half-imagined 1950s Southern California - the clean streets, the nice lawns, the dependable white neighbors who tip their hat and say hi to you as they stroll down the lane. And dammit, they want it \u003ci\u003enow\u003c/i\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWell, the short answer is: I don't know how they're going to get it. It's not going to be possible for them to reimplement racial segregation, or kick all the Asians and Hispanics out of the country. Any serious, large-scale attempt to do that would mean civil war and the collapse of America, which I guarantee would not lead to a nice pleasant racially homogeneous peaceful life for anyone anytime soon.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd what are the other options for creating \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searching_for_Whitopia\"\u003eWhitopia\u003c/a\u003e? Secede? Not gonna work. You can go to small towns and gated communities, but the jobs won't follow you, and by the law of the land, any nonwhite person who wants to can buy the house next to you. So what other options are there? Move to Argentina, I guess. Or maybe New Zealand.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt's this paucity of options, I think, that has so many alt-right people so freaked out. For people who want a white heterogeneous society, there's pretty much just nowhere to go. Until recently there was Europe, but with the rise of substantial nonwhite minorities there, and with most European leaders still committed to allowing large-scale nonwhite immigration, that avenue to Whitopia - or Kekistan, as it were - seems closed down. To those who dream of white homogeneity, it must seem like they're being hounded to the ends of the earth, denied any place to call their home, told everywhere by their leaders to integrate with the nonwhite people nextdoor. No wonder they're going crazy on Twitter.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI wish it were different. I wish there were some island nation where alt-right folks could go, and establish their all-white nation-state. It doesn't seem likely to happen, but if it could, I'd say: More power to you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut the ironic thing is, suppose they did get their Kekistan. Suppose New Zealand decided to become an all-white country (like \u003ca href=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/white-new-zealand-policy-introduced\"\u003eit did in 1920\u003c/a\u003e), and twenty million alt-right types from around the world moved there (giving it about a quarter the population density of Japan). I think it just wouldn't work.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI think people would move there, and find that homogeneity doesn't automatically produce trust and goodwill and social peace. They would find that their population was a highly selected set - it would be made up of people who couldn't get along with the people in their homelands. And they would find that the real thing keeping most of them from getting along with their neighbors wasn't ethnic diversity - it was their own personalities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEventually, social strife would return. Neighbors would feud over land and resources and power and community status. Gunfights would erupt. \u003ca href=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/the-wrath-of-the-killdozer/\"\u003eKilldozers\u003c/a\u003e would be unleashed. The government would lurch from crisis to crisis. Protectionist economic policies would be tried and would fail. The economy would languish. Some people would emigrate, back to the hellscapes of diversity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd those who remained would cling to the theory that \"Diversity\u0026nbsp;+ Proximity = War\". No one likes to give up their cherished social theories, especially if it's the theory that the country was founded on. Just as with Hutus and Tutsis, the inhabitants of Kekistan would \"discover\" ethnic differences that had been there all along. Suddenly they wouldn't be just white people anymore, but Russian-Kekistanis, Italian-Kekistanis, Hungarian-Kekistanis. Strife and distrust would return, and the new country would undergo decades, if not centuries, of brutal upheaval, fragmentation, clan warfare, unstable military rule, competing aristocracies, atrocities, and poverty.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI didn't just make that prediction up, by the way. That's pretty much just the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Japan#Medieval_Japan\"\u003ehistory of Japan\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo although there's certainly a case to be made for homogeneity, I'd say the case is a lot weaker and more uncertain than its proponents believe. And more importantly, there's no path for how to get there - at least, not for a country like America. Except for a few small towns scattered throughout the country, the dream of an all-white utopia is likely to remain just that.\u003c/div\u003e","cites_papers":[12944251,992539,4434236,5084482,2809296,1686571,1346655,4966199,2488426,1289264,7155147,4716159,4537356,19738902,2723718,468509]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"109817851"},"body":"Brian Gleason, a couples therapist and co-author of Exceptional Relationships: Transformation Through Embodied Couples Work, shared with New York Magazine that putting thoughts and anxieties into words to share with one’s partner is important for a flourishing relationship. Such thoughts must be shared with the face out of the screen, facing the significant other, having the uncomfortable conversations, and becoming more comfortable with the conversations. \n\nAccording to a new study in the Journal of Research on Adolescence, there is actually a negative correlation between the amounts of time teens spend on their phones and their ability to work through hard times in their relationships. \n\nThe researchers gave 487 adolescents (median age 14) a questionnaire regarding technology use and relationship skills, such as the primary form of communication between them and their partner. They asked whether communication was technology-based (texting and social networks) or more traditional (talking in person or over the phone). A year later, the adolescents were given the same questionnaire to see whether their relationship skills improved. \n\nResearchers found that 32.3% of participants primarily used traditional methods to communicate with their significant other. 32.8% reported to primarily use technology to communicate with their partners. The remainder of participants (34.9%) claimed to use both methods equally. \n\nResearchers found that those who communicated through technological applications had lower self-reported romantic competencies. On the other hand, those who use more traditional applications had higher self-reported romantic competencies. The correlation was stronger with boys than girls. \n\nJacqueline Nesi, the leader of the study, shared that with electronic communications, “you’re not seeing facial expressions or using nonverbal communications. So, the predominant use of social media may limit the opportunity to practice in-person conversation that are crucial to adolescents.”\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the study doesn’t stamp teen’s Internet use as bad or harmful in general. There are ways to use social media platforms to enforce traditional communication, such as Skype and Apple’s FaceTime. \n\nFull study (Get PDF): http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jora.12274/abstract","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"8941836"},{"$numberLong":"8941836"}]}

{"_id":{"$numberLong":"108853009"},"body":"Green appropriations through shifting contours of authority and property on a pastoralist commons\n\nThe dynamics of customary land rights and displacement among east African pastoralists have been the subject of extensive scholarly inquiry. Displacement to make way for other land uses, government-led privatization schemes, endogenous subdivision to defend land against outsiders, and progressive enclosure of private land in the context of the recent ‘land rush’ are some of the documented trajectories of land tenure change. Less explored is how exogenous authority systems gain traction within common property regimes to re-shape the contours of property. Laikipia, Kenya presents an ideal context for this research given the uniquely ambitious effort to conserve globally significant wildlife on private land. We focus on a group ranch owned collectively by Maa-speaking pastoralists for whom formal title was secured with the support of outside actors vested in conservation, and coupled with efforts to provide financial incentives for conservation. Findings suggest the new governance structure established in the context of land titling has become a pathway through which outside authority gains traction – with consequences for property, sovereignty and the traction of green agendas. Findings deepen understanding of how shifting authority shapes processes of alienation and legitimation, and contribute to ongoing debates about land grabs, tenure formalization and neoliberal approaches to conservation.\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1176562#.V2z8o_l96Uk","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"9009794"},{"$numberLong":"9009794"}]}

{"_id":144139580,"body":"Article: Ephemeral ‘communities’: spatiality and politics in rangeland interventions in #Mongolia | By Byambabaatar Ichinkhorloo \u0026 Emily T. Yeh, 24 June 2016:\n\nAbstract\n\nIn recent years, the number of community-based natural resource management projects for rangeland conservation and development has grown rapidly in Mongolia. Such projects seek to develop social capital through the formation of herder groups and pasture user groups, in order to enable the coordination of complex, collective tasks needed for sustainability. Through analysis of social networks, interviews and ethnographic data from two places where such projects have been implemented, Bayanjargalan, Dundgovi, and Tariat, Arkhangai, the paper demonstrates that the spatiality of pastoral social relations is much more extensive than assumed by these projects. Furthermore, rather than being neutral technical interventions, such projects are embedded in and proliferate politics. They often bolster the informal power of wealthy herders who gain more access to pasture, while at the same time leading to tensions between different levels of government and becoming objects of struggle between Mongolia’s two dominant political parties. For all of these reasons, these efforts have tended not to build trust, and the ‘communities’ they create, in the form of herder groups and pasture user groups, have tended to be ephemeral.","cites_papers":[9136518,9136518]}

Abstract\u003cbr /\u003eThis paper reinterprets the Dust Bowl on the US Southern Plains as one dramatic regional manifestation of a global socio-ecological crisis generated by the realities of settler colonialism and imperialism. In so doing, it seeks to deepen historical-theoretical understandings of the racialized division of nature and humanity making possible the global problem of soil erosion by the 1930s and forming the heart of the ecological rift of capitalism. The framework developed here challenges prevalent conceptions of the Dust Bowl, in which colonial and racial-domination aspects of the crisis are invisible, and affirms the necessity of deeper conceptions of environmental (in)justice. \u003ca href=\"\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1195375\"\u003ehttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1195375\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1195375\"\u003ehttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1195375\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003e﻿","cites_papers":[{"$numberLong":"10119713"}]}

The framework of coloniality conjures history, contextualizing US Department of Agriculture (USDA) racism within long legacies of subjugation, while paying homage to historical resistance. It raises the stakes regarding the neo-imperialism of agribusiness monopolies, while highlighting divide-and-conquer strategies and the colonialist mentalities that linger on despite reform.

Most importantly however, the discursive impact of coloniality builds upon existing, grassroots articulations of the need to decolonize agricultural policy. Calling out the coloniality of US agricultural policy echoes global revalorizations of peasant agriculture, while overcoming the constraints of the term ‘peasant’ in US-English-speaking contexts.

First, we review the feminist literature on women, gender and food sovereignty and make suggestions regarding how to conceptualize the latter to better analyze women’s and feminist struggles on this terrain. Second, we highlight the variety of discourses and practices through which food sovereignty is appropriated in the different spaces and scales of the March. Third, we identify the political dynamics that underlie the uneven deployment of the project of food sovereignty among the national coordinating bodies of the March. Our conclusion stresses the role of discursive articulations and of internal and external alliances as processes through which food sovereignty is both diffused and transformed, and draws some implications for the larger scholarship on food sovereignty.

In this article, I argue that, rather than being a stable concept and easily recognizable phenomenon, humanitarianism only becomes apparent in relation to other categories. In short, humanitarianism is contingent: it depends on circumstance and varies from one context to another. Furthermore, its perceptibility rests on individuals\u0026rsquo; capacity to mobilize categorical similarities and distinctions. One cannot call a thing or person \u0026ldquo;humanitarian\u0026rdquo; without denying the humanitarian character of someone or something else. Drawing on research conducted in clinical spaces where Botswana\u0026rsquo;s national HIV treatment program and private US institutions overlapped, I examine the processes by which individuals claimed people, spaces, and practices as humanitarian, the contrasts they drew to make these claims, and the moral positions they attempted to occupy in the process. More than questions of mere terminology, these processes of categorization and contradistinction serve as crucibles for the larger struggles over sovereignty, inequality, and the legacies of colonialism that haunt US-driven global health interventions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12680/full\"\u003eScripting Dissent: US Abortion Laws, State Power, and the Politics of Scripted Speech\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMara Buchbinder\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbortion laws offer a point of entry for \u0026ldquo;the state\u0026rdquo; to intervene in intimate clinical matters. In this article, I explore the various uses of scripts and scripting in state-mandated abortion counseling following the implementation of North Carolina\u0026rsquo;s (2011) Woman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Right to Know\u0026rdquo; Act. The law mandates that women receive counseling with specific, state-prescribed information at least 24 hours prior to an abortion. Drawing on interviews with abortion providers in North Carolina, I analyze how the meaning of scripting shifts across different clinical and bureaucratic contexts and show that abortion providers perceived themselves to be scripted by \u0026ldquo;the state\u0026rdquo; even though their words were not explicitly chosen by lawmakers. Thus, rather than viewing the law merely as a product of North Carolina legislative activity, I argue that abortion providers also help to create the law, and its social and moral power, by interpreting and enacting it.

These investigators are self-fashioned experts who aim to balance scientific and spiritual perspectives in hopes of researching the existence of ghosts from an objective perspective. Despite actively seeking out ghosts and amassing firsthand paranormal experiences, investigators remain deeply doubtful about the nature of their evidence and the existence of the paranormal. Here, I explore the production and experience of doubt by examining paranormal investigators\u0026rsquo; struggles to define and quantify the paranormal. Competing ideas about the substance or nature of ghosts lie at the heart of this struggle. Paranormal investigators agree that collecting and analyzing electromagnetic energy offers the most promising pathway for establishing empirical evidence of the paranormal. However, there is analytic uncertainty regarding the meaning of electromagnetic energy: it might indicate a spiritual or natural presence. Here, I argue that these two competing frames of interpretation engender and sustain states of doubt among investigators; however, paradoxically, these very states of doubt allow them to maintain and sustain embodied encounters with the very paranormal forces they doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://link.springer.com/journal/41292\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBioSocieties\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/biosoc.2015.45\"\u003eThe hybrid bioeconomy of umbilical cord blood banking: Re-examining the narrative of opposition between public and private services\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eChristine Hauskeller and Lorenzo Beltrame\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eUmbilical cord blood (UCB) is an important source for stem cells used in clinical treatments. For this purpose, UCB has to be collected at birth and stored in biobanks. The discourse about UCB biobanking practices commonly holds that it occurs in two opposite economies, the public sector and a competing private one. They correspond with moral economies of gift-giving in a redistributive economy versus private ownership of cord blood in a market economy. Our analysis of UCB banking in Europe shows that this opposition narrative is both empirically and analytically unsatisfactory. Using the analytic concepts of entanglement (Callon) and biomedical platforms (Keating and Cambrosio), we demonstrate how the network of actors, objects, interests and practices in biobanking creates different kinds of value and shared issues across public and private services. Our case study illustrates how the interrelation between technical, ethical, economic and logistical considerations plays out and generates a field of practices where redistributive and market economies coexist, are co-dependent and hybridize each other. The narrative of opposition therefore can inform STS studies regarding the normative values written into the public facing side of biobanking, but bioeconomic analyses benefit from building on concepts that enable the examination of the complex interrelations between the wider network of heterogeneous elements on which UCB banking relies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/biosoc.2016.5\"\u003eHow to fix a broken heart: Cardiac disease and the \u0026lsquo;multiverse\u0026rsquo; of stem cell research in Canada\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnnette\u0026nbsp;Leibing, Virginie\u0026nbsp;Tournay, Rachel\u0026nbsp;Aisengart Menezes, and Rafaela\u0026nbsp;Zorzanelli\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis article focuses on Canadian stem cell researchers working on therapeutic applications of autologous stem cells for heart disease.

Examining state management of oocyte donation in the context of hESC research, this article considers New York and California as comparative sites of stem cell science regulation, which enriches our understanding of how regulation of stem cell science arises out of an engagement with representative politics and the private sector in the United States. Employing a process tracing of policy development in New York and California, this article highlights alternative democratic pathways to the management of oocyte donation in research contexts: given differences in direct democratic action, legislative representation, executive leadership, and publicly funded state stem cell research institutions, distinct regulatory outcomes occur with important bioethical implications for publics and participants in stem cell science at the state level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41292-016-0027-y\"\u003eChanging cells: An analysis of the concept of plasticity in the context of cellular differentiation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlison\u0026nbsp;Kraft and Beatrix\u0026nbsp;P.\u0026nbsp;Rubin\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis paper analyses the changing conceptualisation of cellular differentiation during the twentieth century. This involved a move away from a view of this process as irreversible to an understanding of it as contingent. We examine the import of this shift for the transformation of stem cell biology, including the therapeutic promise attributed to this field, and how it came to challenge historical conceptions of both the cell and stem cell. We take as our starting point the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine awarded jointly to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. In the view of the Nobel Committee, their work delineates a paradigm shift in the understanding of cellular differentiation, one that incorporates the concept of \u0026lsquo;plasticity\u0026rsquo;. We explore the emergence, uses and meanings of this concept within this specific biological context, examining and emphasising its role as an epistemological tool. In this setting, \u0026lsquo;plasticity\u0026rsquo; was introduced by cell biologist Helen Blau in the course of research undertaken in the 1980s into the genetics of cell differentiation. We argue that Blau\u0026rsquo;s experimental and theoretical contributions were seminal to a reconceptualisation of this process and provide a crucial link between the work of Gurdon and Yamanaka. Overall, the paper highlights the contested process of conceptual change within the biomedical sciences. It also draws attention to the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between conceptual and technical change, exemplified here in the changing conceptions of cell differentiation following from the analysis of gene expression using new cell fusion and cloning techniques. More broadly, the paper also affords a window onto the shifting priorities, goals and values within late twentieth-century biomedical research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/home/bod\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBody \u0026amp; Society\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial Issue: The New Biologies: Epigenetics, the Microbiome and Immunities\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1357034X14561341\"\u003eAntibiotic Resistance and the Biology of History\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHannah Landecker\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeginning in the 1940s, mass production of antibiotics involved the industrial-scale growth of microorganisms to harvest their metabolic products.

We argue that the complaint of \u0026ldquo;thinking a lot\u0026rdquo; indicates the presence of a certain causal network of psychopathology that is found across cultures, but that this causal network is localized in profound ways. We show, using a Cambodian example, that examining \u0026ldquo;thinking a lot\u0026rdquo; in a cultural context is a key way of investigating the local bio-cultural ontology of psychopathology. Among Cambodian refugees, a typical episode of \u0026ldquo;thinking a lot\u0026rdquo; begins with ruminative-type negative cognitions, in particular worry and depressive thoughts. Next these negative cognitions may induce mental symptoms (e.g., poor concentration, forgetfulness, and \u0026ldquo;zoning out\u0026rdquo;) and somatic symptoms (e.g., migraine headache, migraine-like blurry vision such as scintillating scotomas, dizziness, palpitations). Subsequently the very fact of \u0026ldquo;thinking a lot\u0026rdquo; and the induced symptoms may give rise to multiple catastrophic cognitions.

In this article, I draw on the illness narrative of Magaly Chac\u0026oacute;n, the first HIV positive individual in Bolivia to file charges of medical negligence after failing to receive care to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Magaly\u0026rsquo;s narrative demonstrates how structural conditions are often used to explain away poor patient outcomes, shifting attention away from and normalizing the symbolic violence that also perpetuates substandard care of marginalized patients.

The crux of this argument is based on two discrete case studies, one community sample of Nicaraguan grandmothers in urban Nicaragua, and another clinic-based study of Mexican immigrant women in urban United States, which represent different populations, methodologies, and instruments. Yet, both authors critically examine narrative data and then use the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to further unpack meaning of psychological suffering by analyzing symptomatology.

Starting from the observation that memory operates at the core of PTSD symptomatology, we more closely explore how this notion of traumatic memory is conceptualized within PTSD-centered research and interventions. Subsequently, we aim to broaden this understanding of traumatic memory and post-trauma care by connecting to findings from social memory studies and transcultural trauma research. Drawing on an analysis of scholarly literature, this analysis develops into a perspective on memory that moves beyond a symptomatic framing toward an understanding of memory that emphasizes its relational, political, moral, and cultural nature. Post-conflict memory is presented as inextricably embedded in communal relations, involving ongoing trade-offs between individual and collective responses to trauma and a complex negotiation of speech and silence.

During the first Intifada, from 1987 to 1993,1 which constitutes the golden age of Palestinian resistance towards Israel\u0026rsquo;s occupation, the Palestinian resistance movement was characterized by a passionate belief in the possibility of a revolutionary transformation. Due to the consistent stalemate and even worsening of the conflict that have followed in the wake of the Second Intifada, from 2000 to 2003, this passionate belief in the realization of a Palestinian state has been replaced by ambivalence toward that ideal. Based on insights from my intermittent fieldwork with families of Palestinian political prisoners from 2004 to 2011, this article suggests that the contemporary ambivalence surrounding the revolutionary project can be meaningfully analyzed using Freud\u0026rsquo;s notion of melancholia. In Freud, melancholia accounts for the relation between a feeling of indeterminate loss and ambivalent attachment. The notion of melancholia thereby provides anthropology with a concept that can be used to name and explore the frayed attachment to the ideal of a Palestinian state in the context of an ongoing colonial occupation. The passionate politics of the First Intifada enabled a fusing of Palestinian personhood with the overall political project into a subject characterized by active resistance. In contrast, the ambivalent attachment that marks the link between self and state project in the Palestinian territories after the Second Intifada leads to a mood of melancholia. By analyzing the attachment to the political project as an indeterminate loss in the melancholic\u0026rsquo;s ego, I argue that the Palestinian political project is part of the self and keeps its adherents in a repetitive temporal fold from which they are unable to escape, because they are obliged and compelled to keep fighting for a state that does not seem to materialize. Conceptually, melancholia has the capacity to elucidate the emotional and deeply intersubjective toll it takes to live and aspire to an ideal that seems further from realization by the hour.\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/etho.12142/full\"\u003ePublic Anxieties and Projective Identification: Therapeutic Encounters Between Danish Clairvoyants and Their Clients\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVibeke Steffen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe capacity to receive occult messages and look into the future is claimed by individuals in most societies and probably always has been.

This article suggests that the concept of necrosociality provides a useful framework for analysing how social relations are negotiated, reaffirmed, or negated through bodily remains and graves, effectively shaping the modes of being and care among the living.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1548-1387\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMedical Anthropology Quarterly\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial Focus Section: Comorbidity\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maq.12163/full\"\u003eEctoparasitic Syndemics: Polymicrobial Tick-borne Disease Interactions in a Changing Anthropogenic Landscape\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMerrill Singer and Nicola Bulled\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on an assessment of the available research, this article uses syndemic theory to suggest the role of adverse bio\u0026ndash;social interactions in increasing the total disease burden of tick-borne infections in local populations.

Second, it illustrates several social routes through which comorbid suffering can fade into the background of everyday life, even when it is severe.

Participants gave open-ended responses to intimate partner violence (IPV) vignettes (marital rape, emotional abuse, violence during pregnancy). Twelve participants (92%) endorsed personal responses (remaining silent, enduring violence, forgiving the husband). Twelve participants endorsed communication with one\u0026rsquo;s husband. Only four participants (31%) sought family support, and three contacted police. Ultimately, 12 participants left the relationship, but the majority (nine) only left after the final IPV experience, which was preceded by prolonged psychological suffering and pregnancy endangerment.

Building upon debates within Medical Sociology, Cultural Studies and Media Studies we argue that the figure of \u0026lsquo;the doctor\u0026rsquo; is discursively deployed to act as the moral compass at the centre of the programme narrative. Our analysis highlights that the qualities, norms and ethics represented by doctors in space (ships) are intertwined with issues of gender equality, speciesism and posthuman ethics. We explore the signifying practices and political articulations that are played out through these cultural imaginaries. For example, the ways in which \u0026lsquo;the simple country doctor\u0026rsquo; is deployed to help establish hegemonic formations concerning potentially destabilising technoscientific futures involving alternative sexualities, or military dystopia. Doctors mostly function to provide the ethical point of narrative stability within a world in flux, referencing a nostalgia for the traditional, attentive, humanistic family physician. The science fiction doctor facilitates the personalisation of technological change and thus becomes a useful conduit through which societal fears and anxieties concerning medicine, bioethics and morality in a \u0026lsquo;post 9/11\u0026rsquo; world can be expressed and explored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?a=f0r9yuVuTQk:0Gei3UVTvvA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?a=f0r9yuVuTQk:0Gei3UVTvvA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?i=f0r9yuVuTQk:0Gei3UVTvvA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?a=f0r9yuVuTQk:0Gei3UVTvvA:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?a=f0r9yuVuTQk:0Gei3UVTvvA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Somatosphere?i=f0r9yuVuTQk:0Gei3UVTvvA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Somatosphere/~4/f0r9yuVuTQk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"\u003e","cites_papers":[14841752,14913044,12295917,13607350,4982636,6453734,15133655,14192599,15133660,3792679,4250287,12224401,14441629,3791134,3814850,6761267,14519728,10920853,15133675,7320776,8526824,6364001,15133677,5394699,15133679,15133681,15133682,15133683,15133684,15036474,14464659,13921950,2829719,4038957,5009595,5112868,10808807,9095566,4659507,6197084,6206195,10844473,10419352,10981242,12341340]}

Sit back, educate yourself, and return to the fray with tidbits that will heighten your reputation among your co-workers for useful and inspirational pieces of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u0026ldquo;Need for cognition\u0026rdquo; sounds good for a juror\u0026mdash;right?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually we would say the answer to that question all depends on which side of the case you represent. But here is a study that asks if the price of intellectual curiosity is [physical] laziness. Sure enough, they found those low in need for cognition (known in some circles as \u0026lsquo;low information voters\u0026rsquo;) were more physically active while those high in need for cognition (wanting greater amount of\u0026nbsp; information before making decisions) were less physically active. Fortunately, we really don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about this one since what the researchers also found (after more analyses) was that for those high in need for cognition, there was lesser physical activity on weekdays but those physical activity differences [between those low or high in need for cognition] ceased on the weekend. We don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure, but it seems possible that the study might see effects for blue-collar workers versus white-collar, level of education, et cetera. So, not to worry, those curious jurors are going to be focused and alert mentally even if they sit in uncomfortable jury box chairs all day long Monday through Friday. Truth be told, sitting in those chairs might be what they do all day during the workweek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGoing bald? You may want to think about hair transplants!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it has been more than four years since we posted about the \u003ca href=\"http://keenetrial.com/blog/2012/08/01/men-exude-confidence-masculinity-authority-and-power/\"\u003eappeal of the bald head\u003c/a\u003e. Heres what we said then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;re cute and confident with a full head of hair. You\u0026rsquo;re not seen as abnormal with thinning hair but not thought of much otherwise. And when you have a shaved head, you are dominant and tall and even more of a leader. The only real downside for men with shorn scalps is that they were perceived as significantly less attractive than men with thick and luxurious hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shaved head (as opposed to the comb-over) meant you stood out and were seen as a leader. Times may have changed. A new study was just published in the \u003ca href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamafacialplasticsurgery/article-abstract/2544827\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eJAMA Facial Plastic Surgery journal \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003esaying that when 122 adults (between the ages of 18 and 52) looked at 13 separate photos of men pictured side-by-side\u0026mdash;all experiencing age-related hair loss but half having had hair transplants\u0026mdash;they thought the men with the hair transplants were more attractive. Specifically, the participants in this study thought the men with the hair transplants were not only more attractive, but also younger, more successful and more approachable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[We would point out, as a public service, that the men with age-related hair loss but no hair transplants did not have shaved heads and so perhaps that is why they were not preferred to the men with transplants. Also, while the first study was published in an academic research journal by psychologists, the second was published in an academic journal by professionals who may have a vested financial interest in increasing the number of hair transplants\u0026hellip;].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmerica is #7 when it comes to empathy\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it may seem like being in the Top 10 in the list of countries in which empathy was measured is a good thing\u0026mdash;it puts us \u003ca href=\"http://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/study-ranks-63-countries-empathy-ecuador-tops-list/\"\u003ebehind countries like Peru, Korea, and even Saudi Arabia\u003c/a\u003e. Researchers out of Michigan State University compared 63 different countries on empathy and conclude that the US may be becoming less empathic than we once were (as they found in an earlier study of \u003ca href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eob/edobrien_empathyPSPR.pdf\"\u003eUS college students and empathy\u003c/a\u003e). Also important to note is that the study did not differentiate between empathy for those in ones own country as compared to those outside your country. Some think that may be part of why so many Middle Eastern countries (with a lengthy history of aggression against each other) \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161014150930.htm\"\u003erate so high on empathy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThis may be the last chance for Boomers and our elders to get it right!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh. Boomers are often blamed for messing up the economy, not respecting the institution of marriage, ignoring our children in pursuit of dual-career marriages, and likely a few more things not mentioned here. However, according to \u003ca href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/29/this-may-be-the-last-presidential-election-dominated-by-boomers-and-prior-generations/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePew Research Center\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, this may be the last time Boomers ever dominate the presidential elections. So. If you are a Boomer, please get out and vote and make sure you get it right!!!

{"_id":143026592,"body":"Victims or perpetrators? Explaining media framing of Roma across Europe\nAbstract\nDiscrimination against Roma is a reality across Europe. The extent to which stereotyped,discriminatory beliefs of this minority group are reflected or reinforced by news media has received only limited attention. This study investigates media framing of Roma and explains variation in how European news media frame Roma in diagnostic and prognostic terms. We content analysed 825 news articles from newspapers in the Netherlands, Germany, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom for the period 2010–2012. Results show that attention for Roma is clustered around key-events and differs considerably between countries. Our analyses of frame variation, based on multilevel modelling, indicate a duality in the use of frames, with Roma being both portrayed as victims and perpetrators. Variation in these portrayals could be ascribed mainly to sources and newspaper types. This study contributes to our understanding of the factors that account for problem-emphasizing portrayals of Roma in European countries.\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14649365.2016.1206961","cites_papers":[12636672]}

The authors, led by Phil Woodhouse,\u0026nbsp;define farmer-led irrigation development as \u0026ldquo;a process where farmers assume a driving role in improving their water use for agriculture by bringing about changes in knowledge production, technology use, investment patterns and market linkages, and the governance of land and water\u0026rdquo;. Covering a huge array of literature and many cases (although surprisingly very little from Zimbabwe), the paper offers a fantastically useful overview of the debate about what form of irrigation is most likely to support increases in smallholder production and livelihoods in Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper in particular identifies furrow systems in mountainous areas, valley bottom/vlei systems, small-scale pumping from wells/open water, and peri-urban agriculture, as areas where farmer-led irrigation is important. All of these are important in Zimbabwe, whether the famous furrow systems of Inyanga, the \u0026lsquo;\u003ca href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/7341IIED/\"\u003ewetland in dryland\u0026rsquo;\u003c/a\u003e vlei or dambo \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249015485_Struggle_for_control_over_wetland_resources_in_Zimbabwe\"\u003ecultivation in the miombo zones\u003c/a\u003e, small-scale pump systems everywhere, and the massive growth of cultivation in and around towns and cities. Yet such forms of irrigation are often not acknowledged, nor counted in the statistics or supported by donor investments and government policy. This is of course not a new argument, but it\u0026rsquo;s one that has become more pertinent given the rise of small-scale, informal irrigation systems, with the decline of state support for formal schemes and the decline in costs of pumps in particular allowing informal systems to expand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one statistic that really struck me in the paper, based on work by \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273398807_Identifying_the_potential_for_irrigation_development_in_Mozambique_Capitalizing_on_the_drivers_behind_farmer-led_irrigation_expansion\"\u003eBeekman and colleagues in Mozambique\u003c/a\u003e. They estimate that over 115,000 ha are irrigated by farmers on a small scale. Accounting for this area, this would nearly double the national total irrigated area. Perhaps not to such an extent, but the total area irrigated in Zimbabwe is surely a gross underestimate too.

Around 12% of households have irrigated plots on their main fields, while all households have gardens, either at the home or by a nearby river/stream. Even former farm workers living in compounds are buying pumps, as they branch out into farming (see earlier blogs), with 0.2 pumps on average bought per household in the same period. Pumps now cost only around $200 for a cheap Chinese make, and these can irrigate small gardens. Some are upgrading to larger engines, while others are expanding production areas through storage systems, and having a series of pumps. The extent of such irrigated areas is not known, but just taking our study areas in Mazowe, Masvingo and Matobo districts, my estimate is that it\u0026rsquo;s considerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JPS paper highlights five characteristics of farmers\u0026rsquo; investment in irrigation.

Whether this is in new pumps or pipes or furrow systems in mountain areas or in vleis, irrigation requires investments of cash and labour. This is significant, and as we saw in our survey data from land reform areas in Zimbabwe, pumps in particular have become a priority investment, across social groups and geographical areas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInteractions among farmers, external agencies and the rural economy are crucial\u003c/strong\u003e. Too often studies of irrigation focus just on the technology, but not on the interactions required and generated. In Zimbabwe, most new irrigation is spontaneous, independent of the state, NGOs and projects. But connections with the rural economy are important. There is a whole new set of businesses emerging for selling, maintaining and repairing pumps. And the production generated from new irrigation is transforming markets, as we showed in our earlier work, highlighted in our \u003ca href=\"https://zimbabweland.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/making-markets-land-reform-agriculture-and-new-local-economies-in-zimbabwe/\"\u003eSMEAD films\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInnovation occurs in broad socio-technical networks and complex agricultural systems\u003c/strong\u003e. The classic engineering approach to irrigation focuses on flat areas, large water supplies and fixed technology. This is the form of standard irrigation schemes. But farmer-led irrigation manages water in different ways, making use of water within a landscape. Slopes, pits, valley bottoms and so on all become significant in maximising irrigation potential.

This is especially so with mobile, flexible irrigation. Communal tenure or the permit/offer letter system found in A1 areas is not a constraint, as we have seen.

Highlighting the benefits of farmer-led\u0026nbsp;irrigation must be tempered by an assessment of who wins and who loses. As discussed in respect of the new pump based irrigation systems in Masvingo, downstream impacts can be severe, and second-generation challenges of water management are emerging. The investors in these new irrigation systems are usually men (able to buy the pumps) and the losers may be women and other family members, who often have to supply the labour (a theme largely ignored in the review). Gluts of production are common in such systems too, so those surviving along market chains may be affected. As the paper argues, an overall assessment is necessary, but the benefits are significant \u0026ndash; and underestimated.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is a much-repeated narrative about Africa\u0026rsquo;s agriculture \u0026ndash; that it missed out on the \u0026lsquo;Green Revolution\u0026rsquo; due to the lack of irrigation. The comparison with Asia is always made, where approximately 20 per cent of land is irrigated, while in Africa it is supposed to be less than 4 per cent. As discussed above, this contrast is probably not accurate, and far more land is already being irrigated in Africa, but through different systems. Because of rainfall, topography, markets and a host of other factors, Africa and Asia are never going to be the same, and such comparisons are often rather futile. But nevertheless, we should learn more about what is happening with water and agriculture on the ground in Africa. This paper identifies farmer-led irrigation as an important trend, and one that may well be driving an unnoticed Green Revolution in Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was written by \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ianscoones.net/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eIan Scoones\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e and appeared on \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.zimbabweland.wordpress.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eZimbabweland\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/zimbabweland.wordpress.com/1860/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/zimbabweland.wordpress.com/1860/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cimg alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=zimbabweland.wordpress.com\u0026amp;blog=26718278\u0026amp;post=1860\u0026amp;subd=zimbabweland\u0026amp;ref=\u0026amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"\u003e","cites_papers":[13491285]}

{"_id":131905315,"body":"By Steve Wiggins Steve Wiggins discusses how Tanzania could expand irrigation to one million hectares by 2020.","cites_papers":[13491285]}
{"_id":132111275,"body":"Despite increased efforts to expand irrigation in Tanzania, the country is still well below its declared target of one million hectares of irrigated land. Or is it? New research reveals that official statistics often don’t include irrigation set up and run by individual farmers. This would appear to be good news, but very little is known about this under-the-radar irrigation. The big question for policymakers now is how to respond. Over the past decade, efforts to boost irrigation in Africa have increased significantly in response to a variety of issues. These include ongoing low productivity, rising food prices, and growing concerns that climate change will impact Africa’s already unpredictable weather. This could have a knock-on effect on agriculture. Tanzania’s irrigation development exemplifies this trend. The total area of irrigated land doubled between 2004 and 2014. This promises big increases in food security. Crop yields are estimated to be two to four times higher on irrigated than non-irrigated land. Irrigated agriculture already contributes to 24% of Tanzania’s national food requirements from only 4% of the country’s total cultivated land area. The government has shown commitment to ambitious expansion with the implementation of a National Irrigation Policy in 2010 and passing of the National Irrigation Act in 2013. Yet according to the Tanzanian National Irrigation Commission, the country is still well below its target of one million hectares, with only 46% of this currently irrigated. One explanation for this is that there simply isn’t enough irrigation development going on due to funding and implementation constraints. Lack of government budget is a key barrier. But even newer funding and operating models such as public-private partnerships come with their own problems. The positives of these partnerships are counter-weighed by challenges such as a lack of experience in negotiating with commercial partners, difficulties in negotiating access to large areas of land typically expected by private investors, and banks’ reluctance to fund investment in the sector. But there’s also another possible interpretation: that there isn’t actually that much of a lag – and it’s actually more a question of inaccurate irrigation data. Irrigating under the radar New research has revealed that Tanzania’s official statistics on irrigation often don’t include initiatives set up and run by individual farmers. This is either because they’re not aware of it, or because they don’t consider it to have much potential. Compared to formally engineered projects, this ‘farmer-led’ irrigation is often small-scale and interspersed among non-irrigated fields. This makes it harder to record. It also takes diverse forms. These range from watering via pumps, wells, flooded valley bottoms, or even via stream diversions or small dams. The same research shows that farmer-led irrigation is in fact flourishing. It reveals that the area of suitable irrigated farm land is much larger than typically thought. It could be as much as 10-20% larger for rice-growing areas, for example. And it’s not just the case in Tanzania. Research from Mozambique indicates that irrigated areas might be double the officially recognised area if farmer-led irrigation is included, and similar observations are emerging from Zimbabwe. Responding to farmer-led irrigation From a crop productivity point of view, this is good news. It indicates that Tanzania is actually much closer than expected to its national target of one million hectares of land irrigated. But it also raises new questions. First, it’s likely that the undocumented irrigation uncovered is only the tip of the iceberg. So, what is the best way to capture more detail on where and how small-scale farmers are irrigating? Satellite imagery analysis is a possible solution. It has already produced striking findings suggesting that across Sub-Saharan Africa irrigation may be two to three times greater than previously thought. In some countries, such as Ethiopia, it’s very much greater. More importantly, perhaps, it raises questions about how governments should respond to farmer-led irrigation. Should it be supported, and incorporated into official irrigation strategy, or approached with caution? At the moment, it’s hard to say. Although this type of irrigation is slowly becoming more visible to official eyes, understanding of its social, economic and hydrological impacts is still very limited. It may increase crop yields, but at what cost? For example, does it benefit everyone in a given community, or just a few individuals? How do women and non-locals fare? Is it environmentally sustainable? It’s vital that government officials charged with meeting Tanzania’s irrigation target look into these questions. They could start by mapping out where and how farmer-led irrigation is happening. Only then can they make the best decisions about whether or how to embrace farmer-led irrigation.","cites_papers":[13491285,13491285,6373106]}

It will show that that counter-hegemonic demands are not synonymous with counter-hegemonic practice; rather than struggling to replace the neoliberal food regime, many peasant organizations employ the food sovereignty discourse as a political tool in their negotiations with the state in order to access resources from within the prevailing neoliberal model, not to transform it.","cites_papers":[13794131,13794131]}
